            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Publiſhed about two Years ſince, ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons called, <hi>The Great Propitiation;</hi> and thereto Added a ſhort Diſcourſe concerning the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning by <hi>Juſtification by Faith, without Works.</hi> About half a Year after, there came forth a Learned Book, called, <hi>Harmonia Apoſtolica,</hi> written by Mr. <hi>George Bull,</hi> which quite croſſing the Interpretation I had given of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I was Occaſioned by ſome Occurrences, which it concerns not the Reader to know, to Write the ſubſtance of theſe Reflections upon it, which were Written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in leſs than three Months after it's coming forth, without any Deſign of Printing them. And ſince I had Written this, there is Publiſhed a Diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Charles Gataker (Thomae</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Filii</hi>) wherein he ſignifying his diſlike of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s, Propounds a third way to Reconcile the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>James.</hi> What my thoughts are of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s way, you will here ſee. I think he hath in the main, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken right concerning the ſenſe of Saint <hi>James;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49565:3"/> But I think Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> hath given the right Interpretation of neither, and judg that I have ſaid enough in my Book fore-mentioned, to make it appear, and ſo hath Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> in his.</p>
            <p>I grant, and lament it, that many Important Doctrines of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by too many groſly Explained, ſo as to have ill Conſequences following from them; which if rightly Explained, would be found not to Patronize, but to diſown ſuch Conſequences. And hence many Learned men, ſeeing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerableneſs of ſuch conſequent Opinions, and not being able to Extricate themſelves, deny Important truths, and maintain ſuch Opinions as theſe following (which are the Foundation of the greateſt part of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Book oppoſed, and would make an intolerable change in the very ſubſtance of the Body of Divinity) viz. <q>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no Law that threatens Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-death, or promiſed Future-happineſs, but the Goſpel or Law of Grace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Jewiſh Law, or Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had only Temporal Promiſes and Threats, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired only External Obedience.</q> (Which yet, you will ſee, I grant in one Limitted ſenſe of it, to be true.) <q>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That no Law of God whatſoever requires perfect Obedience, and ſo no man is bound to live perfectly, or free from
<pb facs="tcp:49565:3"/> ſin. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And that for this Reaſon, becauſe no man is bound to do what he cannot do.</q> (Which Reaſon is only true in a ſenſe, nothing to the purpoſe; but it is dangerouſly falſe, to deny a man is bound to do what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, in another ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon the account of his Morally inſuperable wickedneſs, as I have elſe-where at large ſhewed.) <q>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That, for any Evidence we have from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the contrary, men after Converſion, or after the receiving of the Goſpel, do live perfectly or without ſin, or do as much as any Law of God requires from them. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the effect of the Grace of the Spirit is ſomething, that if denied to men enjoying the Goſpel, they would be excuſable or blameleſs, in not obeying the Goſpel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo, Theſe following Expoſitions, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very ſubſtance of the ſenſe of moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant parts of Scripture. <q>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> doth not diſpute againſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by perfect Obedience to the Law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible to man in this Life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That our Lord in the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> doth not vindicate the Law from corrupt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but adds to it, making that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that never was ſo before.</q> (Take notice, I charge not this laſt mentioned Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:49565:4"/> as maintained by Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> though it be by many others; and though it muſt follow by conſequence, if what he maintains be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law had no Internal Precepts.)</p>
            <p>I judg, what I have here written, may be of uſe for the clearing of thoſe in Diſpute, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other paſſages of Scripture, and for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of many dangerous Opinions, or I ſhould not have permitted it's Publication. I ſhall not here needleſly uſe Proteſtations concerning my Fidelity, in repreſenting, by a Tranſlation, Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Diſcourſe, ſince it is commonly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſign of Guilt, to cleer one's ſelf before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. If any ſhould ſuſpect me of Diſingenuity herein, let me deſire them to read the paſſages here replyed to, out of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Book it ſelf. And to encourage (ſo far as my word will paſs) them that have it not, to procure it; I ſhall ſay, that much of it is well worth Reading; and that I am far from paſſing that cenſure on the reſt of the Book, which I do on the parts here replied to. May but what is here written be ſo read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, without prejudice and paſſion (which may well be expected from ingenuous Lovers of Truth) that it may have free Influence upon mens underſtandings according to the evidence it brings: I ſhall not much doubt of it's good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in compoſing many differences in Opinion; Which is the Prayer of the Author.</p>

               </gap>s of the chief Places he deſigns to reconcile.</p>
            <p>He divides his whole Diſcourſe into two Diſſertations; The firſt whereof is about the meaning of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in ſuch Expreſſions as that cited, and is ſo ſhort as not to take up a fifth part of the Book; The ſecond about the ſenſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary Affirmations, taking up all the reſt of the Book.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49565:6"/>
            <p>His whole firſt Diſſertation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in affirming Juſtification by Works as a condition, is Acute, Solid, and Cogent; yea, and ſo is all generally in his ſecond Diſſertation to the <hi>5th.</hi> Chap. and part of it; he ſpending thoſe Chapters in diſcovering the weakneſs and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the attempts of many deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconcile ſuch places, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> means not one ſingle virtue by Faith, but the whole Goſpel-condition, the whole duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Salvation, or the obedience of Faith. And I judg thus much of it (which is near one third part of the Book) highly worth the Reading of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have any other apprehenſions of the meaning of <hi>James,</hi> or that are not ſatisfied that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> by Faith, means the whole neceſſary duty of a Chriſtian.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49565:6"/> he faſtens on the Apoſtle is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from his meaning, and would not only make the whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, about denying Juſtification by works, a vain uſeleſs Speculation; but alſo would bring in ſuch intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinions as theſe following, at leaſt by evident conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is no ſuch thing as pardon of ſin poſſible as to Eternal puniſhment, or puniſhment after this Life; neither did Chriſt ſatisfie for the breach of any Law as to any Eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or puniſhment after this Life, but onely for Temporal. Not that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the Author holds this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for it is apparent he holds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) but this follows by undeniable conſequence from his diſcourſe, though he ſee it not, but will deny this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

            <p>1. His denying, that there is any ſuch thing, as any Law of God (ſetting the Goſpel it ſelf aſide) made with Mankind to this Tenour or Purport: That he that doth not every thing that God requires of him whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Light of Nature, or the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49565:7"/> of the Old and New Teſtament, ſhall be ſubject to Eternal miſery, or miſery after this Life; and if men do all that God requires of them; by any way making his will known, they ſhall be eternally Happy, or Happy after this Life; but he thinks, There is no Law of God that threatens future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or promiſes future happineſs, but only the Goſpel it ſelf, which is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old and New Teſtament: And that any Law threatning future miſery (I mean after this Life) or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing future Happineſs, is the Goſpel it ſelf, whereby men alwayes were and are juſtified and ſaved.</p>
            <p>Now to prove againſt this, and that we muſt hold a Law threatning future and Eternal miſery to all ſinners, and that all are condemned and none juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Law, and that this Law is diſtinct and quite different from the Goſpel, let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
            <p>1. If there be no Law diſtinct from the Goſpel, threatning future miſery, or miſery after this Life, then Chriſt never ſatisfied for the future miſery that was threatned to any; never died to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49565:8"/> free any from the wrath to come; from the eternal or future Curſe of any ſuch Law; but only from a temporal Curſe, or Curſe of this Life. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is apparent, becauſe he knows not what he ſays, that ſhould affirm, that Chriſt was made under the Goſpel, to free us from the Curſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for the Goſpel either threatens nothing (as many hold, but I judg them to err) or, which is apparent, it threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens nothing except to them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not its condition, <hi>viz.</hi> To them that Believe not, and Repent not in this Life, and it is certain Chriſt died not to Redeem finally Impenitent Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's Satisfaction was made to the Law, and not to the Goſpel: to free them that perform not the condition of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> perfect Obedience; but not to free them that perform not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel. There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſatisfaction made to the Law, that God might with Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with ſafety to the Law make this Act of Oblivion, this Law, of Grace, the Goſpel: Therefore ſurely that firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49565:8"/> Original-Law did threaten eternal death to ſinners, and not meerly Temporal puniſhment, elſe there cannot poſſibly be any ſatisfaction for ſin, as to Eternal puniſhment at all, becauſe the firſt Law to which the ſatisfaction was made, did not threaten it. Suppoſe a Law in force that every Felon ſhall be ſold to work in the Galleys, and the King's Son paid a great price, and, by this, obtained of the King this conditional Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made, that if ſuch Offenders will ſerve his Son in the Wars, they ſhould be Acquitted, but if they ſhrink from ſuch Service, they ſhall die. Here indeed was a price paid to free them from being Gally-ſlaves, but none paid to free them from Death; becauſe the firſt Original Law that was tranſgreſſed by their Felony did not threaten Death, but only Slavery. And you cannot ſay, that the price was paid to free them from the Penalty of the Law of Grace, or Act of Oblivion, which doth threaten Death, but the ſatisfaction was made to the firſt Law only; though indeed the Act of Oblivion or Remedying Law, was made upon the account of the price
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49565:9"/> paid in ſatisfaction for the breach of the firſt Law.</p>
            <p>2. If there be no Law threatning wrath to come, or future miſery but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Goſpel it ſelf, then no man can be pardoned, or can need pardon by the Goſpel, or the Bloud of Chriſt as to the wrath to come; for the Goſpel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no pardon to its tranſgreſſors, that is, to men continuing to death in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Unbelief. The Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed affords pardon to transgreſſors of the Law; yea, and to transgreſſors of the Commands of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo far as they are tranſgreſſions of the Law (and threatned by that general Law, Curſed is he that doth not all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way revealed to be his duty) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they perform the Goſpel-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but the Goſpel affords no pardon at all to them that fall under its curſe, by not performing the Goſpel-condition. Suppoſe a Law made threatning every Felon with Death, and ſuppoſe a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Act of Oblivion, or Remedying Law made, that if the Felon read, he ſhall not die; the pardon is only as to the firſt Law and Breach of it; for there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49565:9"/> is no pardon as to this ſecond Law, and Breach of it, for if he do not read, which is the condition of the ſecond Law, there is no pardon for his failing therein. So that if the firſt Law never threatned Eternal death, there can be no pardon as to Eternal death.</p>
            <p>And which maketh it ſtill apparent, is this: Pardon muſt be by ſome Law, (elſe it may be Forbearance, or Reprieve, but no Pardon) and no Law can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in any caſe whatſoever, afford par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Offences againſt it ſelf; it is a contradiction to ſay it may. For, (to anſwer an objection that may be in your mind) ſuppoſe a Law made, threatning the Offenders only conditionally; as threatning death except a man abjure the Realm, or pay a ſum of Money; in this caſe if the perſon either abjure or pay the Money, here is no pardoning any thing the Law threatned, for the Law never threatned his death abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. So that you ſee there cannot poſſibly be pardon of a tranſgreſſion from the Law it ſelf, but only from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, a Remedying Law, or Act of Oblivion. Therefore the Goſpel which is an Act of Pardon, or Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49565:10"/> for thoſe that are guilty of the breach of another Law, cannot poſſibly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don an offence againſt it ſelf, which is failing in the performing the condition of it, by dying in Unbelief: For any that will affirm pardon in the failing in the condition of this Act of Oblivion, he muſt affirm ſome new Law made (for a Remedying Law to one caſt by the Goſpel) to this effect, That if men die impenitent they ſhall be ſaved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they or others for them, perform the condition while they are in an other world, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> affirm ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a kin to. Now if the Goſpel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford no pardon to them that perform not its condition, as it is impoſſible it ſhould, and no Law elſe threatens Eternal death, there cannot poſſibly be any pardon of ſin as to Eternal death. So that you ſee, whatſoever this Author ſaith to the contrary, we muſt hold a Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eternal death, or Wrath to come, (which Chriſt hath undergone a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſatisfaction of) diſtinct from the Goſpel, or the Law of Grace, that was founded upon the account of this ſatisfaction; and that all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49565:10"/> by this Law; and that as to Future and Eternal concernments; and that none are Juſtified by it: Which if the Author had conſidered, he would ſurely have told us better than he hath done, what the Apoſtle meant by the Law, and works of the Law, which he denies Juſtification by.</p>
            <p>Yea, and you muſt hold, that this Law threatning wrath to come to every Offender is yet in force, and not Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the Goſpel; yea, and that it threatens men that do perform the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-condition as really as others. I ſhall not deny that ſuch a Law ſeiſeth upon mens being ſinners, as to the Promiſſary part (as a promiſe made to a man if he ſhall work all ſuch a week, doth ceaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath failed the firſt day) but it is actually in Force ſtill with its penalty requiring perfect Obedience, and not only ſincere; which I thus prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Elſe we muſt ſay, that no man ſins or tranſgreſſeth this Law, ſo he do but perform the Goſpel condition, ſo he be but in the main a ſincere Chriſtian; and conſequently that no ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian needs Chriſts ſatisfaction or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49565:11"/> for ſuch ſins as are conſiſtent with Goſpel ſincerity; which is an Opinion which I almoſt dread to mention, though the Author ſeems very confident in it, for he maintains, <hi>pag.</hi> 108. 112. That, ſo men do but chiefly mind the beſt things, do but obſerve the main Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law, no Law whatſoever requires any more of them; and alſo holds, that men after <note n="*" place="margin">I cannot tell whether he mean after Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or after the meer Preaching of the Goſpel to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hem; but however I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onſtrue it to the beſt ſenſe.</note> Converſion, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Goſpel, for any diſability on them to the contrary, may, and for any evidence we have in the Scripture to the contrary, do, live ſuch lives as not to ſin any ſin that deſerves, or is by any Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much as conditionally with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death (and ſo it follows conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as any one ſees, that they need no pardon, or the Blood of Chriſt for ſuch ſins as to Eternal puniſhment) though yet he grants (but yet, any one may ſee, with ſome reluctancy) That <hi>pag.</hi> 117. All do ſometime or other of their lives commit ſome either ſin, or ſins, that deſerves Eternal puniſhment, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49565:11"/> conſequently needs pardon, and the Blood of Chriſt. Now if it be true that he ſaith, that, No Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any more than that men keep the main ſubſtantials of it, and make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion their buſineſs; then he may ſafely affirm, that they do not need pardon by the Blood of Chriſt, for any ſo much as temporal puniſhment as to thoſe fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are conſiſtent with true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. I grant the Goſpel requires no more for our Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than ſuch ſincere imperfect indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as he mentions: but I cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough expreſs my diſlike, of ſaying, No Law doth require any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Law was abrogated by Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the Goſpel, as to its requiring perfect Obedience under a threatning of the penalty of Eternal death, of thoſe that continue performing the Goſpel-condition; Then we muſt not ſay, that Chriſt died to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardon of thoſe ſins that are conſiſtent with Goſpel-ſincerity, but died to prevent them from being Sins, and Tranſgreſſions of the Law, that would otherwiſe have been ſins; or to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49565:12"/> prevent ſuch ſins from legally deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or being threatned with Eternal wrath, and ſo to prevent them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardoned by his Blood, as to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another great Miſtake that cauſeth his other Errors, (as any one may perceive that reads his Book) is this, That he doth not underſtand, or doth not conſider the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Original Law, with a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Law, or conditional Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion diſtinct from the Original Law; and a Law that threatens a tranſgreſſour of it, only conditionally. I ſhall make my meaning appear by an Inſtance which he brings of an Original Law, and a Remedying Law (though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he brings it not under that notion, but ſpeaks ſomthing not right concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and eſpecially he is widely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in making that the chief, yea, the only Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt Juſtification by in thoſe places, where he ſpeaks againſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the works of the Law, though yet I do think that the Apoſtle had in ſome places a main reſpect to this Law
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49565:12"/> of Sacrifices now to be mentioned, as <hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. Heb. 7. 11. 19. Chap. 9. v. 8. 18. Chap. 10. v. 1. &amp;c.</hi> The Inſtance is this, <hi>Page</hi> 121, 122. where he rightly tells us; <q>That God did make a Law that concerned the <hi>Jews</hi> as a Common-wealth, that every one that tranſgreſſed the Law ſhould die by a violent death,</q> (<hi>viz.</hi> Either I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the Sword of the Magiſtrate if publickly known, or God would in Judgment cut them off himſelf) <q>But God in mercy, that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity might not be deſtroyed by the death of the Multitude of Offenders</q> (and alſo I ſuppoſe to Typifie our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concernments in reference to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life) <q>made another Law concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt of thoſe offences (for ſome offences were for great reaſons excepted from this Act of Oblivion, and were to be puniſhed with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death without mercy) that if the Offender offer a Sacrifice, he ſhould be ſpared, and it ſhould be accepted in his ſtead.</q> Now to the matter in hand: Suppoſe that the firſt of theſe Laws had it ſelf run thus conditionally,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49565:13"/> that if any man commit any ſuch offence He ſhall die a violent temporal death, or ſome Beaſt for him. In this caſe, we could not have ſaid, that this Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Offender's blood, but his or the Beaſts indifferently; neither could we have ſaid if he had offered a Beaſt, that he was pardoned; ſince the Law threatned not his death, but his or the Beaſt's, and ſo there was nothing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or pardoning any thing the Law required: We could not ſay that the Beaſt died as a ſatisfaction to the Law, that the Law might not be executed; for if the Beaſt died, the Law was Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, according to the utmoſt ſeverity that it threatned without pardon; We could not ſay the Beaſt died to expiate his guilt and obligation to die; for he never was guilty of Death, never was threatned with death by this Law, but He was to die, or thus part with his Beaſt indifferently.</p>
            <p>But now, conſider this Inſtance as it was in truth an Original Law, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Offender's death abſolutely, and a Remedying Law diſtinct; and we here ſee, that an Original Law and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49565:13"/> Law, are well conſiſtent both in force. We cannot ſay, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Law that threatned the offender's death abſolutely, was null'd, or abrogated by this Remedying Law, but it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in force; only there was a Remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law in mercy, provided to free from the penalty, that, though due to the firſt Law, it ſhould not be executed. We cannot ſay, the offender's death was not threatned by the Law, or that he was not guilty of death by that Law; we cannot ſay, the Beaſt died to hinder the man from being guilty of death, ſo far as concerns the Law: but that, though he was <note n="*" place="margin">We read expreſly, that in the caſe of ſacrifice for ſin, there was guilt, or obligation to the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and attonement, or exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea, pardon cannot be at all, without a Law in force obliging to puniſhment, for the offence pardoned.</note> guilty by that Law, that he ſhould not be guilty with the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus redundans in perſonam,</hi> that it ſhould not be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. You cannot ſay, the man was not pardoned as to his death, becauſe the Beaſt died for him; for he was pardoned, the Law was not executed; for it threatned his death abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely: nor, that the Beaſt did not die a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49565:14"/> ſatisfaction to Juſtice, that the Law might not be Executed, by pretending the Law was executed without pardon, by the death of the Beaſt. So, that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal-Law, [<hi>Curſed is every one,</hi> with a curſe after this Life, <hi>that obeys not in every thing,</hi>] may be actually in force conſiſtent with the Remedying Law, the Goſpel, That if a man be a ſincere Chriſtian, a ſincere Servant of God in the main, he ſhall be free from that Curſe. You cannot ſay, If a man be a ſincere Chriſtian, perform the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition, he ſins not againſt any Law in force; nor, that the ſins that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true Chriſtianity, are not threatned with Eternal death; or, that he is not condemned dayly for ſuch ſins by that Law; or, that he is not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to Eternal death, as to thoſe ſins, pretending that no Law in force threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them with Eternal death; or, that there cannot be an Expiation for them, they not being ſins, or threatned with any Eternal penalty: You cannot ſay, that Chriſt died not a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, that the Law-threat might not be executed, pretending the Law was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49565:14"/> executed without pardon; for the Law threatned us abſolutely, and not Chriſt at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another great cauſe of his Miſtakes, is, his not underſtanding the difference between <hi>Natural-Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> (which is when a man hath not the Natural Faculties, or Abilities to do a thing, as being a Natural-Fool, or Deaf, or Blind, or hath not a ſufficient propoſal of the Object to be known, or believed; and they that have not this Natural-power of doing a thing, are not bound by the Law of God, to do what they have this Natural-impotency to, and ſo do not ſin in the not doing it) and <hi>Moral-Impotency,</hi> which is wilful wickedneſs, and doth not in the leaſt excuſe men from obedience to the commands they have only this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to the obeying of. Now the not underſtanding of this, cauſes that Self-contradicting Notion of his, from <hi>pag.</hi> 104. to <hi>pag.</hi> 114. where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf moſt fluently, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt his whole Diſcourſe (I do not much wonder at this, ſince every man muſt neceſſarily contradict himſelf in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49565:15"/> all he ſaith about ſuch things, that doth not keep notions clear and diſtinct about this Diſtinction, which too few do) where he tells us, <q>He cannot be of the judgment of the moſt, who hold, that the Law doth oblige men, if not abſolutely, yet conditionally, except they flie to the Covenant of Grace, and that under the peril of Eternal death to abſolute Obedience, that is, ſuch Obedience as excludes all ſin.</q> And for this reaſon, he cannot be of this Judgment, Becauſe no man can do it. And adds <hi>pag.</hi> 108, <q>That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he holds, that the Law threatens only thoſe that do not do all things the Law requires them to do?</q> What? Is not this perfect Obedience even to Innocency, to do all the Law requires men to do? If a man do all the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to do, he doth perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law; he doth not ſin except he fail in ſomething the Law requires from him. Strange ſpeech! No Law of God he ſaith, requires perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe no man can perform perfect Obedience; therefore the Law requires no more than a man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49565:15"/> Is not this to ſay, That the Law doth only require what a man can do, and yet all a man can do, is not all the Law requires, is not perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If no Law require a man to be free from thoſe ſins he ſpeaks of, that are conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, then thoſe ſins are lawful; and the doing of ſuch things as are lawful, cannot hinder a man from being innocent; can be no hindrance to his perfect obeying the Law.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is a Contradiction in the very Words, keeping to the ſame Law (as the Authour doth) to ſay, Any Law doth not require perfect Obedience; for it is to ſay it doth not require all that it doth require. We may indeed ſay, the Goſpel doth not require the perfect Obedience of another Law, that is, the whole condition of the Original Law, which it was made to pardon our failure in; becauſe ſincere Obedience only to that Original-Law, was made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it: but it is impoſſible but the Goſpel being a Law (it is a Law of Grace, commanding ſincere obedience, with a penalty of our otherwiſe not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49565:16"/> the benefit offered by it); I ſay, it is impoſſible, but that it ſhould require perfect Obedience to what it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as it's condition, whereon we ſhall attain the pardon offered by it; and this condition is perfectly all that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as a Remedying-Law, or Act of Oblivion: For, if there be any thing that it doth not require of us, ſo as we ſhould loſe the offered Pardon if we do not perform it; this thing is not it's condition, nor any part of it, which is required, that we might not ſo fall ſhort. Alſo, as was demonſtrated before, No Law either doth, or can, remit any thing required by it ſelf. If a man fail in any thing required by the Goſpel, under the penalty of having no benefit by it, he is Remedileſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another fundamental cauſe of his Miſtake of the Apoſtle's ſenſe, is, want of true notions about the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he thinks to be a Law that had only Temporal Promiſes and Threats, and to be void of Spiritual and Internal commands; and alſo that the Apoſtle only excludes it, and its works, from Juſtification. Now becauſe I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49565:16"/> know not of any that ſpeak exactly, and ſatisfactorily of the Law, in the ſeveral Notions and Acceptations of it, nor in all things <note n="*" place="margin">I mean, not rightly, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly enough, ſo as to include all the ſenſes of it here to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</note> rightly, (however not in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in this may poſſibly differ from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers); I think it needful to ſpeak here ſomething largely and diſtinctly of it; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Author's Opinion about the Apoſtle's ſenſe, ſince that may be done in few words: but that I may lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the right underſtanding, not only of the paſſages of the Apoſtles in debate; but other paſſages alſo of this Apoſtle, and of the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> reſpecting the Law; where they take it in a different ſenſe from that wherein it is mainly taken in the places now in diſpute. My thoughts are theſe:</p>
            <p>The Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-diſpenſation, may be conſidered as to Temporal reſpects only; or, as to Conſcience, or Life-to-come Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And firſt, to ſpeak of it as to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral

This would take up too much time to ſpeak more particularly &amp; exactly of.</p>
            <p>I would ſpeak more plain if poſſible: let me Repeat it in other words, which may be plainer to ſome underſtandings. I ſay, the Law may be conſidered in this External political ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as the Offences might be Expiated by their Sacrifices, or were excluded po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively by it, from being expiated by their Sacrifices (for that Excluſion was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49565:18"/> meant only as to Temporal puniſhment, taking no notice of the Future or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal): In this ſence, it had only, as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments of Offenders, ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temporal promiſes of Peace, or Proſperity, or Long-Life in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon obedience to the Law; and alſo had, in this ſenſe, no Spiritual or Internal precepts.

This amazingly-ſtrict Law as to Temporal puniſhment, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as given with, or comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, a Remedying-Law, as to theſe Temporal ſeverities, <hi>viz.</hi> As afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon upon Sacrifice, as to theſe threatned Deſtructions, for the moſt Tranſgreſſions; (not for all, as one may be apt to wiſh, for Type-ſake; for the community muſt not be ſundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally prejudiced to make a Type more full, by pardoning all offences as to Temporal puniſhment upon ſacrifice.)

            <p>Now it is apparent, that the Law and Covenant, or Teſtament of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> is often taken in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Law under this conſideration, ſo far as it threatned only what might be remitted by Sacrifice, or threatned what was denied by it to be remitted upon Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Yea, no man can poſſibly give any rational account of the meaning of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the places where he ſpeaks of the Law; but by affirming, he takes it in this ſenſe, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. For the Law, only in this ſenſe was Typical; and not at all Typical, but the reallity, in the ſenſe I ſhall after ſpeak of it in. He ſhews, the Law made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to Conſcience, or future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; and that Sacrifices did not Expiate any further than as to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Fleſh that they might come into the Congregation, and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49565:19"/> the taking off of Temporal guilt and Puniſhment; but not as to Eternal, or Future-life puniſhment; or coming to the Congregation in Heaven; and alſo ſhews that they were a commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of Sins as to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Future puniſhment, but not an Expiation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 3, 4. And that they did ſo far (<hi>viz.</hi> as to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment, and being excluded the Congregation) really Expiate being offered in the offender's ſtead: And, elſe indeed they could not have been Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of the great Expiation, if they were not Expiations as to ſome things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; no more than the Brazen-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent could have been a Type of Chriſt's Healing or Saving, if it had never healed any. So the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is taken alſo, <hi>Acts 13. 39. By him all that believe, are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. That is, from all ſuch great Crimes, as Idolatry, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which there was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> taken in this ſenſe; but ſuch were to die without mercy, no Sacrifice being appointed,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49565:20"/> or accepted in their ſtead: Though yet there was pardon for ſuch by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> taken in the ſenſe I ſhall ſpeak of it in, <hi>viz.</hi> In the ſenſe wherein it was the Goſpel made in the Blood of Chriſt, and in the ſenſe wherein <hi>David</hi> was, yea, and all others were, Juſtified and Saved by it.</p>
            <p>For it is apparent, that a man might go to Heaven upon true Repentance by that Law (taken in the conſideration, I ſhall ere long ſpeak of it in) that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death without mercy (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28.) was due to, by that Law: no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation being allowed for his ſin, he ſinning contemptuouſly, or preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or with a high hand, in the ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30. (which are <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28. interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>He that</hi> contemptuouſly <hi>ſinned againſt,</hi> or ſet-at-nought, <hi>Moſes Law, i. e.</hi> in ſome ſtubborn and vain-glorious way;) or he committing Idolatry, Adultery, or Murder, or ſome other particular Crime excluded, as Blaſphemy, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Curſing or Smiting his Father or Mother, defiling the Sabbath, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtubborn and rebellious Son. As
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49565:20"/> for Inſtance, <hi>David</hi> was pardoned and went to Heaven, and he never offered Sacrifice for thoſe his Crimes; for there was none appointed or admitted in ſuch caſe; for he was by that Law, in the ſenſe in hand, to Die without mercy; and ſhould have been put to Death, had there been any Superiour Authority on Earth to do it; except ſome Prophet had come from God, who, being chief Rector, could diſpenſe with his own Laws, to tell ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that God had pardoned him as to Temporal puniſhment; or God, had ſome way notified, he would not have the Law executed on him. And it is alſo apparent, that a man might be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no Fault, threatned by the Law in this ſenſe, but what was fully Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Sacrifices, as to Temporal violent Death, and Excluſion from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and yet go to Hell, being no true Penitent, or ſincere Servant of God. Becauſe all the Crimes that a man might poſſibly be only guilty of, might be Expiable, and newly Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sacrifice, ſo far as their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices could expiate, though he never
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49565:21"/> truly repented. It was only in ſome few caſes of Injuſtice, that there was Confeſſion to the party, and Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the party wronged, required, elſe this Sacrifice was not accepted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as to Temporal guilt, <hi>Lev. 5. 5. Chap.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>I would have ſpoken more largely and particularly, of the Law under this Conſideration; and have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> here, why the Apoſtles ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take it only in this ſenſe (which I ſuppoſe, I ſhall do ſome-where upon occaſion, before I have done) but I am ſenſible I am ſomething out of my way in ſpeaking ſo largely here, as I have done. And now I have thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I can make little more than this uſe of it, ſhould I keep ſtrictly to ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the places of the Apoſtle in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, than to lay it quite, or almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and to make it appear that the Author had done well, unleſs he had ſpoken more exactly of it, to have done ſo; and to wiſh every one would do ſo, (<hi>viz.</hi> would lay it aſide) for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting them, when ſpeaking or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49565:21"/> moſt of the places in diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> Places denying Juſtification by the Law, and Works of the Law; ſince it is apparent, he ſpeaks of Juſtification as to Conſcience, and Future life, and ſpeaks of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law as referring to Conſcience, and Future life, (which ſenſe I now come to ſpeak of that Law in.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be conſidered as to Conſcience (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience eſſentially reſpects the Future ſtate) and Life to come-concernments, <hi>viz.</hi> as requiring Obedience with a promiſe of Future happineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Peril of Future or Eternal death; and alſo as Remitting and Pardoning ſins, as to Future miſery. Now in this high important ſenſe, this ſame Law (I mean materially, and in words the <hi>ſame</hi>) muſt be conſidered, both as a ſtrict Law, and a gracious Law or Goſpel. What is a Law, but a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Rector's will any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, obliging the Subjects to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by promiſing rewards to the Obedient, and threatning puniſhment to the Diſobedient. Now in this very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49565:22"/> Law in this high ſenſe, there are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of his Will, both of an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrict Law, conſtituting Eternal or Future death due to every Tranſgreſſor; and of a Remedying-law, promiſing Pardon to Tranſgreſſors upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſincere Obedience: even as in the Temporal conſideration of the Law, (already ſpoken of) there was a Law requiring the Offender's blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his failing in the leaſt in it; elſe there could have been no Pardon of him as to violent death upon a Sacrifice, if the Law had not threatned death to him; and alſo there was the Remedying-law of Pardon upon a Sacrifice: So here this conſideration, This very Law given in the ſame words at <hi>Sinai,</hi> did Reveal and Signifie theſe formally-diſtinct Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A ſtrict exacting of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all their lives, to all that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, under the peril of Future death, or wrath to come; elſe, as I have made apparent before, there could be no Pardon as to wrath to come, or Satisfaction by Chriſt for wrath to come, due by this Law, as to ſuch ſins.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49565:22"/> And in this ſtrict ſence, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the word Law in the moſt of thoſe places in Diſpute, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor chiefly inſiſts on, to reconcile them to St. <hi>James, viz.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and <hi>Gal. 3. v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. And in this ſenſe the Law was no Type or Shaddow, nor to vaniſh away, but ſtands in Force unto this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Alſo it did Reveal, that though they ſhould ſometimes during their life (which is enough for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by this Law in the firſt ſenſe) fail in obedience to it; yet their condition ſhould not be hopeleſs, the Puniſhment made due to them by this Law ſhould be pardoned, and they ſhould yet enjoy the promiſed Future life, upon condition they did Repent, and ſincerely love and ſerve God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring Obedience to all his Laws, Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial, with the prevailing deſign, and bent of their Souls. Now in this ſenſe, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was no Type or Shaddow, but the very Goſpel, the Word of Faith which the Apoſtles Preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49565:23"/> 6, 7, 8. And in this ſenſe, <hi>David</hi> takes the Law in moſt of his Encomiums of it, and in this ſenſe Juſtification and Salvation, are not denied to it, or the Works of it, by the Apoſtle, to them that lived under this Diſpenſation; nor to us by it: For it yet continues the ſame for ſubſtance, having the ſame Sanction, and Condition, or Precept in the general, <hi>viz.</hi> That if we ſinners repent, and ſincerely obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he will be our God to Bleſs us, to Juſtifie and Save us from all our ſins; Though many of the former particular Precepts are ceaſed, and ſome new ones added, and the whole Diſpenſation more intelligible and clear. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though it was given deſignedly (as to the end of the Revelation of it) as a Covenant of Grace and Pardon, even for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners, and not for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; yet it was given (ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtill as to the ſame end of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) alſo to Reveal the Law in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exacting Rigour. For though an Original ſtrict Law may really be, and ſo may be Revealed without a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying-Law;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49565:23"/> yet it is a plain impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Reveal, (however ſo as Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould be ſenſible of pardon and favour in it) a Remedying-Law of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (as this from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> mainly as to the deſign of it, was) without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing and making known the ſtrict Original-Law. For, without knowing what the Law in its Rigor requires from us, and what it threatens to them that fail in the leaſt, we cannot be thankful for Pardon offered on the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-terms of Sincerity, nor know, we ſtand in need of Pardon ſo we be but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Neither can this Author poſſibly reconcilably to his Principles (as you will ſee) tell us how Pardon is either needful to one, or poſſibly conſiſtent with, performing the Goſpel-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince he maintains, That ſincere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience, or the Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is all that any Law of God ſo much as requires. Thus you ſee my Judgment concerning the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> And that I ſuppoſe that Threat [<hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written</hi>] had theſe four ſignifications, or did notifie theſe four
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49565:24"/> diſtinct Sanctions, with their diſtinct Conditions. <hi>1ſt.</hi> Every one ſhall be puniſhed with a violent Temporal death, or, ſuch death ſhall be due to him, that obſerveth not every External Precept. <hi>2ly.</hi> Every one ſhall remedileſly be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the foreſaid death, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in the great Inſtances exempted from Pardon, or in other faults, and obſerveth not the Sacrifices appointed for the Expiation of them. <hi>3ly.</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Death or Wrath to come, ſhall be due to every one that obeyeth not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Command, both Internal, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. <hi>4ly.</hi> This Future-death ſhall remedileſly befal every ſuch Offender that ſhall not repent of his ſins, and ſincerely endeavour obedience to every Command, Internal, and External. And to the like extenſive Import, <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis mutandis,</hi> that Promiſe [The man that doth them, ſhall live in or by them] may and ought to be Interpreted.</p>
            <p>Now you will ſee theſe four grand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes which I have here ſpoken to, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the failings of his whole Diſcourſe, in determining what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> means by Works, and by the Law,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49565:24"/> in denying Juſtification by Works, and by the Law; which Diſcourſe I ſhall now propound to your View, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſome of it Verbatim, yea, all that is Argumentative in it, without leaving out any thing in the leaſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and telling you when I leave out any thing that is not, but may ſeem, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. Which I thus begin,</p>
            <p>The Author having before made it apparent, that though Faith in ſome other paſſages of the Apoſtle, doth mean one particular Grace; yet in thoſe Speeches where he ſpeaks of Juſtification by it in oppoſition to Works, he means by Faith all required to Salvation, the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith: He tells us, <hi>Chap. 6. pag.</hi> 98. <q>That the Apoſtle doth not exclude all Works from Juſtification, but Works of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that in ſo doing, in excluding them, he doth alſo reject the corrupt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations or Opinions, which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> had faſtned on this Law, or added to it: And alſo that the Apoſtle, though ſpeaking lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about it, and on the bie, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly affirm that Works done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49565:25"/> to the Law of Nature, and proceeding from the ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth avail nothing to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. He tells us what works of the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> in theſe words, <hi>pag.</hi> 101. <q>This Law conſiſts of two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of Moral and Ritual Precepts: The Apoſtle without doubt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them both. For that he ſpeaks alſo of the Moral Precepts of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whatever ſome ſay to the contrary, is too manifeſt out of his own words, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. Wherefore by the Works of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight: for by the Law is the knowledg of ſin.</hi> From whence it may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is that Law by which is the knowledg of ſin, whoſe works he he excludes; which without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is ſpoken of the Moral-Law written in the Decalogue. For ſo the Apoſtle expounds himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. citing that out of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi> So <hi>Rom. 3. 31. Do we deſtroy the Law by Faith? God forbid, yea, we eſtabliſh
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49565:25"/> the Law.</hi> Now the Ceremonial-Law, can ſcarce be ſaid to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Faith. The Law worketh wrath: For, where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion, is chiefly true of the Moral-Law: For almoſt, all Tranſgreſſions are againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Law; therefore the Diſpute of the Apoſtle, pertains alſo to the Works of the Moral-Law. In the mean time, I muſt add this, that the Works of the Moral-Law, are not ſimply excluded by <hi>Paul</hi> from Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but only ſo far as they were preſcribed in the <hi>Moſaic-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and were made part of the condition annexed to this Covenant. It is certain that no man could come to true Juſtification by the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> by Works of the Moral-Law, though they were rightly, yea, and exactly performed, according to the Rule of the Law; becauſe, it promiſed no true Juſtification at all, That is, Juſtification joyned with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal-Life. For, that great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit comes only from the Covenant of Grace, made in the Blood of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49565:26"/> Mediator. So that, if you reſpect the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> even the works of the Moral-Law, are together to be excluded from Juſtification, and are indeed excluded by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I know you are at a loſs about the Author's meaning; what he means by this <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> that no man could be juſtified by, as to Future life, though free all ſin, and perfectly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moral-Law; becauſe, this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic-Covenant,</hi> promiſed no Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to Eternal life, upon any terms whatſoever. Now becauſe you will not underſtand what he ſaith here, on the two Arguments he brings in the next words, which he pretends are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtle's Arguments againſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by this <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> and that this is all the Law and Covenant, that the Apoſtle proves againſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by; I will bring together here, all that he ſaith, to tell us what he means by the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> that there is no Juſtification by, as he ſaith, as to a Future life, though there was as to this Life; and you will ſee it apparent, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49565:26"/> he means by it only that Law, or Laws, which I before cited out of him, by the name of an Original-Law, and Remedying-Law, which threatned a violent Temporal death to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Law; and promiſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offering a Sacrifice, they ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape ſuch violent Temporal death; but promiſed nothing of Happineſs in a Future life, if they offered ſuch Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; or Pardon of thoſe ſins as to a Future life: He apparently either means this Remedying-Law only, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the Original-Law, as it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a violent Temporal death, and the Remedying-Law freeing from a violent Temporal death, upon the death of a Beaſt: And he thinks, that the Law taken in ſuch a ſenſe as to threaten Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, or promiſe Eternal life, was the Goſpel it ſelf, and that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not diſpute againſt being Juſtified by any ſuch Law; And that the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> however had no Promiſes or Threats of a Future life, not ſo much as obſcure ones; and he builds the ſenſe he gives of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> upon this Foundation. You
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49565:27"/> have ſeen this paſſage already, where he ſaith, it promiſed no Eternal life-Juſtification, to any whatſoever, though Sinleſs, and perfectly keeping the Law, <hi>Pag.</hi> 208. <q>The Promiſes and Threatnings of the Law, were only Temporal and Earthly, <hi>Pag.</hi> 210. And the Precepts did wonderfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the Promiſes <hi>Pag.</hi> 212.</q> He ſpeaks largely to prove this. <q>The Apoſtle doth in many places tax this defect of the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> that it had no promiſe of a Future life. And hither ſome refer that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Law was weak through the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. ſay they, It contained only carnal Promiſes: But I chuſe rather the common Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> for <hi>Sin.</hi> The <hi>5th.</hi> verſe of the foregoing Chapter, is more appoſite, where the Law is called <hi>Fleſh;</hi> for thoſe words, <hi>When we were in the Fleſh,</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>When we were under the Law,</hi> as is manifeſt from the Antitheſis, which they have to <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. and alſo from the ſcope of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the <hi>Moſaic-Law</hi> ſeems to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49565:27"/> be called <hi>Fleſh;</hi> not only becauſe the moſt of the Precepts were carnal only, and External, but alſo becauſe the Promiſes with which this Law was enforced, did not look beyond this Carnal life. To the ſame ſenſe <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> expounds the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. where he calls the Law, <hi>a Miniſtry of Death,</hi> becauſe all its Promiſes were ended with Death, without any hope of Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So <hi>v.</hi> 6. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to kill, <hi>viz.</hi> as the ſame <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> notes; As the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word to make <hi>alive,</hi> is uſed of him who did not kill a man, <hi>Exod. 1. 17. Judg.</hi> 8. 19. So, that is ſaid to kill, which leaves a man to die, and doth not free from Death. But that I may confeſs the truth, I rather believe theſe Phraſes [to Kill, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of death] to ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make men Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Divine anger, and Eternal death, if it be alone, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Spirit; not through

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. ſeem more clear. <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but he that doth them, ſhall live in them:</hi> That is, the Law neither requires Faith, neither doth it promiſe thoſe things which require Faith or Belief, properly ſo called (<hi>which is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. Rom. 8. 24.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it promiſes only good things of that ſort, which are things of Senſe, and belong to this viſible World, but ſaith not a tittle concerning a Future life: It excites us not to Piety, with any promiſes of this ſort; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we do its commands, not adding any ſuch promiſe to excite us: Only ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt live</hi> here a proſperous and fortunate life, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. but that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. is moſt clear: <hi>If there had been a Law which could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49565:28"/> have been by that Law.</hi> The Law is ſaid to give, or do, what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. The ſenſe thereof is, If the <note n="*" place="margin">Here He lays the fault on the Law, and denies it virtually to be the fault of the Man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying what he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</note> Law had had promiſes of life, (<hi>viz.</hi> Eternal) then men could have attained by the Law, true and perfect Righteouſneſs, or true and perfect Juſtification; that is, Juſtification conjoyned with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: But the matter was far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the Law contains only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belonging to this Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Being no better ſupplied with proofs, than with theſe out of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he brings ſome out of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and might have brought many more, and clearer, to ſhew, that Author means by the Law, the Law of Sacrifices, which Sacrifices did only expiate Temporal guilt, as real propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifices; and not at all guilt as to Eternal puniſhment, but only Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that which did.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 215. Queſt. <hi>Is there no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal life, extant in the Old Teſtament? Anſw.</hi> Either you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49565:29"/> mean by the Old Teſtament, the Covenant made in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> or all things contained in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giography,</hi> and the Prophets. If ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the latter ſenſe, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be granted, there are ſome, not obſcure, hints of a Future life, though not a clear and expreſs Promiſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. But theſe hints, ſuch as they were, were only <hi>Praeludiums,</hi> and <hi>Anticipations</hi> of Goſpel-Grace. They did not belong to the Law. For the Law as it is conſidered by the Apoſtle in his Diſputations with the <hi>Jews,</hi> doth properly denote the Covenant made in Mount <hi>Sinai, Gal.</hi> 4. 24. And that, had earthly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and earthly only. It is true indeed, that thoſe earthly Promiſes, added to the Law of Works, were ſigns of thoſe good things which did follow the Law of the Spirit, and thoſe were comprehended in them, in the intention of God himſelf. It is alſo true, that there are extant ſome general Promiſes, or Promiſes made in general terms, in the Law it ſelf, in which it is manifeſt, that Eternal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49565:29"/> life not only might be, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Gods Intention, As [<hi>I will be thy God, and I will Bleſs you</hi>]. For, who doubts but in theſe Promiſes thus generally pronounced, there might be contained every ſort of good things, yea, thoſe which come only after Death? For God to be willing to be one's God, what is it elſe, then God to be willing to embrace a man with Divine good Will? Now Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine good Will, or Benignity wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, What is it elſe than the higheſt Benignity, and than which there can be no greater, or further? And therefore with a Benignity moſt long in duration, that is Eternal; moſt powerful in Operation, and therefore freeing from Death and Deſtruction. For, it is manifeſt by the Interpretation of Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, that Life-eternal in the Intention of God, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe words, ſee <hi>Mat. 22. 31, 32. Heb. 11. 16. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18. compared with <hi>Chap. 7. 1. Rev.</hi> 21. 3. 7. But theſe things do not ſuffice that we may ſay, that Life-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49565:30"/> was promiſed in the <hi>Moſaic-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> For, Promiſes annexed to a Covenant, ought to be clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and ſuch as may be underſtood by either Party: but it was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any one ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Typical, and general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, without ſome adventitious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Again, this Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life ſhadowed with Types, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe general Promiſes, was not given to the external Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs required in the Letter of the Law; but to that ſpiritual Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Piety, of which this other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, was only a ſhadow. For, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Eternal good things lay cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the bark of Temporal good things; ſo alſo the Bodily-Religion preſcribed in the Law, was a Shadow and Type of Spiritual-Righteouſneſs, to be revealed more clearly in the Goſpel. In a word, the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Carnally, and according to the Letter, neither required Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-Righteouſneſs, nor promiſed Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-life; but being conſidered Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, was the very Goſpel it ſelf,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49565:30"/> neither doth the Apoſtle move any controverſie about here it, being ſo taken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pa.</hi> 232. He again largely tells us what Law it was, that the Apoſtle only meant when he exclude's the Law, and Works of the Law, from Juſtification; where denying the Spirit to be given by that Law, he thus ſpeaketh.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If by the Law, you underſtand the Covenant made in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and given to the <hi>Iſraelites, Moſes</hi> being the Mediator, which I have even now ſaid, is the moſt proper and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Acceptation and Notion of it in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, it is manifeſt it contained no Promiſe of the Holy Spirit. But in other Books of the Old Teſtament, yea, and in the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though not in the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant</hi> it ſelf; we may find a Promiſe cleer enough, of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Grace of the Holy Spirit to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as that, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. The Lord thy God ſhall circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. Now this cannot be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49565:31"/> done, as all that differ from <hi>Pelagius</hi> confeſs, without a great force of the Holy Ghoſt. But this did belong to the Goſpel-Righteouſneſs, which firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and after other Prophets, did ſhew to lie under the Bark of the external Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; for the Righteouſneſs of Faith which is manifeſted in the Goſpel, was in times paſt, teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law, and the Prophets, as the Apoſtle expreſly affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. Yea, I will ſhew you further, that this was part of the New Teſtament promulgated by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, that the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 29. and 30. in which theſe words are found, was plainly diſtinct from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth contain a Renewing of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, of the Goſpel-covenant, then more obſcurely Revealed, may be Demonſtrated by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>

            <p>1. <q>As for the Precepts, there are only commanded here, <note n="*" place="margin">There are no particular Laws recited, not ſo much as the Ten Commandments, in theſe two chapters, which he will have to contain this whole Covenant.</note> things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and which are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Honeſt, there being no mention here made of thoſe Rites whereof the whole Legal-covenant is almoſt full, which being conſidered according to the words, may ſeem childiſh; and further, the whole obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, may be <note n="†" place="margin">So may equally all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted by the people, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them by God.</note> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            </p>
            <p>2. <q>As for the Promiſes, God here promiſes full Remiſſion of all ſins upon Repentance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the moſt <note n="‖" place="margin">So he doth as fully from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Lev. 26. 40, 41.</note> hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 3, 4. which favour was never granted in the Legal covenant; And further, the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby the hearts of men may be circumciſed, that they may love the Lord with all their hearts, and ſouls, is clearly promiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 
               <q>That Covenant which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold, <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32. &amp;c.</hi> was a Goſpel-covenant, as all Chriſtians grant, and the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſly teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. Now all thoſe things which the Prophet foretels of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, do <note n="†" place="margin">Alluſions being too much built on, may be Illuſions.</note> exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this <hi>Moabitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant. Jeremiah</hi> calls his Covenant, a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49565:33"/> new Covenant, altogether different from that which God plighted with the Anceſtors of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt; Moſes</hi> ſaith the ſame of the <hi>Moabitiſh-covenant: Jeremiah</hi> gives this cauſe why God would make a new Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they brake the Old, wanting Gods power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Grace; The ſame reaſon <hi>Moſes</hi> gives here, of making this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Deut. 29. 4. Jeremiah</hi>'s, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed circumciſion of heart; ſo this: That promiſed Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. So this, <hi>Deut. 30. 1, 2, &amp;c. Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of the clearneſs, and facility of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which are contained in the New-covenant, that they might know and obey them, without much ſearch and labour: So doth <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12. compared with <hi>Romans,</hi> 10. 6. All theſe things ſeem very clear to me. I have dwelt ſomething long upon theſe things; Both that it may be manifeſt hence, that all things in the <hi>Moſaic-writings,</hi> do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called; And to ſhew how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49565:34"/> it is to reſtrain the old Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, only to the Covenant made in Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And alſo, chiefly that the Wiſdom of God might appear, in diſpencing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. God had made that gracious Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> many years before the giving of the Law, to which Covenant, it afterwards pleaſed him to add another Covenant, made up of many painful Rites and Ceremonies; by which he might keep in their Duty; that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain from the Idolatrous-worſhip of the Heathen, the rude and carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> lately brought out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and ſo, too much addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Paganiſh Rites, and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the moſt wiſe God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, that this People of a fooliſh, or hard-heart (<hi>obtuſi pectoris</hi>) would not underſtand his purpoſe; after he had made this carnal Law, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate</hi> a New-covenant to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> or rather, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new that Old-covenant, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before had made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49565:34"/> which did chiefly require ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Righteouſneſs, and was full of Grace and Mercy. That from hence the <hi>Jews</hi> might know, that the <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamatical-covenant</hi> was yet in force, even after the Ritual-Law was made; and alſo was to be accounted for the Covenant, by which only their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be attained, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.

            </p>
            <p>Since this here recited, hath ſome dark ſhew of proof, I ſhall before I go any further, manifeſt that the Author is notoriouſly miſtaken, in affirming that the Covenant made in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> was not the ſame for ſubſtance, repeated with that made at <hi>Horeb,</hi> or Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> but a Covenant having quite different Promiſes, and Precepts, the one carnal and earthly, the other Spiritual and Heavenly; and alſo in thinking that theſe two Chapters, <hi>29th.</hi> and <hi>30th.</hi> comprehended the whole Covenant made in the Land of <hi>Moab.</hi> Let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
            <p>A Covenant in the ſtricteſt propriety of the Word, is a mutual Engagement
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49565:35"/> of Parties, two at the leaſt. If one ſide promiſe, his part is not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, except both do. So that, that tranſaction between God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Sinai,</hi> was properly a Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. though God had not yet told the People what Laws he would require Obedience to in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for <hi>Moſes</hi> come's with a meſſage to the people from God, and tells them, that if they will obey his Voice, and keep his Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Law, they ſhould be a peculiar Treaſure unto him, and a Kingdom of Prieſts; that is, <hi>He would be their God to bleſs them, if they would be his people to obey him.</hi> This was Gods Promiſe in this Covenant; the people give this anſwer unanimouſly, <hi>We conſent, we will obey God in all his Commands, be they what they will, though they were not told yet what his Commands ſhould be.</hi> But this, though a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was but in order to the great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of this Covenant, which was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Where having given the Moral-Law, the Ten Commandments, and ſome Judicial and Ceremonial Laws; <hi>Moſes</hi> comes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49565:35"/> down from God, and relates them to the people. And the people anſwered, All that the Lord hath ſpoken, <hi>We will do;</hi> meaning, all that he hath, or ſhall ſpeak; for the addition of new commands, did not make ſo many New-covenants. Well, Now God hath promiſed on his part to be their God, if they will obey his Law. <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth theſe Laws that are rehearſed in the 20, 21, 22, 23, chapters, and conſecrateth ſome young men to offer Sacrifice (for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were not ſeparated, till the year after) He made the people confirm their Covenant by Sacrifices, as we do by Sacraments; He read the Book of the Covenant, that is, the Book com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Laws fore-mentioned, and he ſprinkles the Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices on the people, and ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Blood of the Covenant which God hath made with you, concerning all theſe Words, that is, all theſe Commands.</hi> Thus the word is uſed moſt properly of ſuch a Tranſaction, God hath engaged himſelf to bleſs them, if they would ſerve him; and they have engaged themſelves to ſerve him.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49565:37"/> Sometimes the word Covenant, is uſed for the Promiſe of one of the Parties only, as Gods conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that if we will in ſincerity Love, Serve, and Obey him, he will be our God to bleſs us. This is not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, but a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Promiſe; yet is ſo called frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture, becauſe it is Gods part of the Covenant, yea, all God's part of the Covenant of Grace, and all that he Seals or Promiſes; and when we do in ſincerity promiſe our part, theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make it actually a Covenant; He engaged actually to bleſs us, and we to ſerve him. Yea, if we promiſe only hypocritically, yet we are engaged ſo as we are guilty of Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though God is not engaged by his conditional Promiſe, we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing real in performing the condition.</p>
            <p>So our promiſing, engaging to obey, may be called our Covenant, becauſe it is our part of the Covenant; and all required of us, is, ſo to engage, and be real in it.</p>
            <p>But moſt frequently in Scripture, the Laws of God, the Precepts themſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49565:37"/> are called the Covenant; being the Laws that God hath made Promiſes to the obedience of, and that the people by their engagement are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. Sometimes the word is uſed in other ſenſes, as for an abſolute Promiſe, as that of deſtroying the World no more with a Flood; but theſe ſignifications before named, are all that I ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>Now to make it appear, that the Promiſes and Precepts, of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> were the ſame; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>This Book of <hi>Deuteronomium,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the ſecond Law, is ſo called, as all agree; becauſe it contains a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws formerly promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, almoſt all of them were made at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> above thirty nine years before this <hi>Deuteronomium</hi> (this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Law) was Spoken, or Written. The occaſion of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Law (which may well be called, the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Fare-wel Sermon) was as follows: That actual
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49565:38"/> Covenanting that was made at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or <hi>Horeb,</hi> was in the firſt year, yea, within two months after they came out of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 19. 1. And all the people that were Twenty years old at their numbering, which was in the ſecond year after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are now dead, for their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, except <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo there was great need to cauſe this new Generation of people, to enter actually into Covenant, to keep Gods Laws, which <hi>Joſhuah</hi> cauſed them to do again after, at leſs than half that diſtance of time.</p>
            <p>The appointed time of the end of the forty years, drew near, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples entering the good Land, and <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt not bring them thither, nor enter himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Moſes,</hi> well knowing all theſe things, and that his departure was at hand, for he died within a Month after his beginning this Repetition of the Law to the people; for he began it the firſt day of the Eleventh Month, in the Fortieth year, and died in the end of that Month, for the people mourned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49565:38"/> for him Thirty dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Month after, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. 8. compared. I ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing this, and earneſtly deſiring to tye the people (that he was about to leave) faſt to God, and his Laws; he begins, in the hearing of the people, in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> a Month before he died (<hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 3. 5.) to take an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe, to inform them in the knowledg of God's Laws, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to Obedience, by reciting, and Summing up the Tranſactions of God, towards them in the Wilderneſs, and all the Laws Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial (yet leaving out for the moſt part, thoſe Judicial and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial commands, that concerned the Prieſts Office, or were not of ordinary Practice) and adds ſome commands, eſpecially concerning things to be done by them, when they come into the Promiſed Land: And affectionately exhorts them to obey theſe commands, with all their Heart and Soul, ever and anon intermixing diſcourſes of the Bleſſings would come on them by their obedience; and Miſeries by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49565:39"/> This is the Sum of his Diſcourſe to this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. He that ſhall think, that all the Promiſes, and Threats in this Book hitherto, do only <hi>mundum ſonare,</hi> are only Temporal; ſure a vail is upon his Eyes, and Heart, in reading the Old Teſtament. And then, in this <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. Having thus far prepared them to do what they do knowingly, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately, He engages them in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (even with an Oath which was more than was done in <hi>Sinai</hi>) to keep all theſe Laws. He begins his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to this actual Engagement, as at <hi>Sinai,</hi> with theſe words, [<hi>You have ſeen] v. 2. v.</hi> 9. keep therefore the words of this Covenant (that is, the commands that I have repeated unto you) that you may proſper in all that you do, <hi>v.</hi> 10. You ſtand here this day all of you, before the Lord your God, your Captains, your Elders, your little Ones, your Wives, that you ſhould enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his Oath which the Lord maketh with thee this day; that he may Eſtabliſh thee to day, for a people to himſelf; that He may be unto
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49565:39"/> thee a God, as he hath ſworn unto thy Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, i. e.</hi> to give their Seed this good Land. And tells them, If they forſake God, and God bring on this Land the curſe of the Covenant, written in the Book of this Law, and make it like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> and men ſhall ſay, What means the heat of this great Anger? It ſhall be anſwered, <hi>Becauſe they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers, which He made with their Fathers, when he brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt (that is, which he made almoſt Forty years ſince with the Fathers of this Generation at <hi>Sinai) v.</hi> 21, 25. And He ſpends the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> (which the Author makes part of his New-covenant) partly in telling them God would, when caſt out of their Land for their ſins, yet, admit them again to it, if they repent and turn, as He told them before; alſo (what ever this Author ſaith of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no Repentance) as you may ſee apparent, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, 41, 44, 45, 46. Yea, this place of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which is ſaid expreſly to be ſpoken at <hi>Sinai,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49565:40"/> v.</hi> 64. is rather more expreſs for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, being accepted, than this the Author ſo much inſiſts on. And partly in telling them, that he hath told them plainly, what the Laws of God are, which if they obſerve they ſhall live, and need not go beyond the Sea, to enquire what they may do to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and partly in warning them to keep theſe Laws.</p>
            <p>The whole contents of this Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> to the end of this Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Chapter,</hi> was not only ſpoken to the people within a Month before his Death, which is apparent; but it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, within a few of the firſt days of the Month, the latter part of the Month being taken up, with his writing it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 9. And giving a charge to the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> and in his preſenting himſelf with <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> before the Lord in the Tabernacle, that God might give <hi>Joſhuah</hi> a charge, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 9, 10, 14, 15. and in Speaking and Writing the Song, called <hi>Moſes Song,</hi> and teaching the people it, <hi>v.</hi> 22.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49565:40"/> Fare-well Speach of <hi>Moſes,</hi> all of it, (however to the <hi>29th.

And it is commanded, that when they ſhould have a King, that he ſhall in the beginning of his Reign, Write out a Copy of this Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 18. The laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Book, was added by ſome other than <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is apparent; It's likely by <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> You ſee now, there is no colour to pretend, that the Covenant ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 39. 1. means only that <hi>Chapter,</hi> and the following; much leſs that theſe Two <hi>Chapters</hi> only of all <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, have only Spiritual commands, and Spiritual promiſes; and give way and make Promiſes to Repentance. For, as for the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Laws in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> it doth not Recite the Laws they were here engaged to obey, not ſo much as the Ten Commandments, whereof ſome are ſure Spiritual commands, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49565:41"/> the ſincere obſerving of them, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the condition of the Goſpel, but ſhew plainly, This Covenant obliges them to keep all the Laws given at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And for the Promiſes, and Threatnings, they are expreſſed in as Terrene Expreſſions here, as in moſt other places. And as for this of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40.

            <p>As for <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 29. 1. [<hi>Theſe are the words of the Covenant which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes, <hi>to make with the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Moab, <hi>beſide the Covenant which he made with them in</hi> Horeb]. It ſeems apparent to me, that this <hi>verſe</hi> hath reference to the Laws, and Precepts before Recited by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his paſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the people, and the meaning of the words is this: Theſe fore-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Commands, are the Laws which the people covenanted to keep; which covenanting of the people, the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to require from them, in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> beſide

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49565:43"/> Covenant, diſtinct from the words whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> engaged them in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to the Lord formerly.

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Pag</hi> 103. The Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſes the Law, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſorts; one into thoſe which belong to the whole <hi>Moſaic-Covenant;</hi> the other, into thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which chiefly reſpect the Ceremonial Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This latter ſort of Arguments, which chiefly reſpect the Ceremonial-Law, he leaves till near the end of his Book,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49565:44"/> and then ſpends but few Lines about them, as not being (as he ſaith) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by Chriſtians.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Arguments of this firſt ſort, whereby the Apoſtle fights, are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two; and thoſe are taken from a double defect of the <hi>Moſaic-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, viz.</hi> From the want both of pardoning Grace, and of helping Grace.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument of the Apoſtle reſpecting the <hi>Moſaic-Covenant,</hi> is drawn from the defect of Pardoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or Remiſſion of ſins, which that Covenant wanted: Where the Apoſtle ſhews the Univerſal guilt, as well of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and that all are guilty of thoſe ſins, that there is no true and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be hoped for by this Law. It is clear, that this is the ſcope of <hi>Paul,</hi> in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long Catalogue of ſins, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Law, <hi>v. 10. &amp;c.</hi> At length, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he inferrs this concluſion, <hi>Wherefore by the works of the Law,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49565:45"/> ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> viz. <hi>in the ſight of God.</hi> And alſo, the things which the Apoſtle diſputes in the <hi>3d. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gal.</hi> are to be referred the ſame way; where he proves alſo by this Reaſon, That all who are under the Law, are under a Curſe; becauſe it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one, that ſhall not continue in all things written in the Law, to do them,</hi> v. 10.</p>
               <p>But here I am ſenſible, that upon the very Threſhold, I am caſt upon a great difficulty. For it may be doubted here, whether this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Apoſtle, doth not lean upon this Foundation; that he determines, The <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> as it was given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a Law requiring Obedience wholly perfect, and ſo impoſſible to be performed; and alſo, whether the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that upon this account, all men are ſinners by this Law, and by, and for their ſins, guilty of eternal Death, and Malediction; and ſo, that no man can be Juſtified by this Law. Thus indeed the moſt think, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49565:45"/> that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige (if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, yet <note n="†" place="margin">Conditionally is no good word here; For though we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſay, Men ſhall periſh for their ſins conditionally, except they repent, for this is no more than to ſay, the Law that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens death abſolutely, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ecuted except they repent; yet we muſt not ſay, that the Law threatens death conditionally except they repent; but we muſt hold it threatens death abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent or repent not, and that the Goſpel is a diſtinct Law, a Remedying-Law. For if God threatned death by the Law, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditionally, except they perform the Goſpel-condition, it would follow that no man is pardoned that performs the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel condition, it would alſo quite deſtroy Chriſts Satisfaction. Though I know many mean well that uſe ſuch ſpeeches, and however far better than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that denies any ſuch Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threat, either abſolute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.</note> conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> unleſs they fled to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-covenant) all thoſe to whom it belonged, and that under the peril of Eternal death, to moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute obedience, that is, ſuch as comprehends all manner of ſinleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, and that perpetually, and did forbid all Imperfection, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, and Infirmity through the whole courſe of their lives. But I cannot be perſwaded to the opinion of theſe, for Reaſons which I ſhall preſently give. In the mean while, that you may more rightly underſtand the ſtate of this Controverſie; keep
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49565:46"/> this exactly in your mind, that theſe two things do widely differ, <hi>viz.</hi> A man to be accounted by God, unworthy of the reward of Righteouſneſs and Eternal life: And a man to be accounted of God, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be puniſhed with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eternal death. For the firſt, For a man to be judged unworthy of Eternal Life, it ſufficeth that he is not altogether Sinleſs; for God may, and that righteouſly, deny him the reward of Eternal Life for the leaſt Imperfection. For God might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that infinite Gift of Eternal Life to a man obeying perfectly, if ſuch a one could be found; becauſe it is a free Gift, and cannot be due to the Merit of any Creature: But for that laſt, That one ſhould be accounted by God, worthy of the puniſhment of Eternal death, it is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that he did not perform that Obedience which he could perform. Hence it follows, that no man can righteouſly be adjudged guilty of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, for the defect of perfect Righteouſneſs, ſince this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49565:46"/> is ſimply impoſſible to a man in this Life. And it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtle in the Diſpute of which we ſpeak, doth prove all <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without difference, for not obeying the Law, not only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the reward of Eternal life, but obnoxious to Divine anger, and Eternal death, <hi>That every mouth might be ſtopped,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. that is, that all <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> may be without excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and 2. 1. And what is more unlikely (that I may uſe here, the words of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>) that the Apoſtle would charge men to be guilty of Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for violating, or not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Law which he judged it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to keep: Neither is it likely, that <hi>Paul</hi> had any Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries but what would grant, that no man could keep the Law ſo exactly, as not to offend in the leaſt, and ſo no man to be juſtified in that ſenſe by the Law; And who would not alſo object to him, that men were ill accuſed to be guilty of Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, when it is certain, they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49565:47"/> could not avoid the fault. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all here ſaid, is this, That it is repugnant to Divine Juſtice, that any ſhould be bound to Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">Pag 106.</note> eſpecially under the peril of Eternal death.</p>
            </q>
            <p>He here make's out, That, that-uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pretence of ſome, is very abſurd, that men have loſt their power to do what God requires of them, and ſo God may juſtly require what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now do; which I grant, and have elſewhere proved to be ſo abſurd, as no way to anſwer that difficulty.

            <q>
               <p>And to come to the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> it is far more unlikely, that it was a Law requiring perfect Obedience.

               <p>It remains therefore to be affirmed, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience under the former conſideration [<hi>viz.</hi> As the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jewiſh Government.]</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe we read expreſly,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49565:48"/> that God by <note n="*" place="margin">It was not by that Law formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, but by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying-Law different from it.</note> that Law, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifices by which the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were not done in contempt of the Law, and with a high Hand were expiated, as may be ſeen, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. from the <hi>22d.</hi> to the <hi>29th. v.</hi> Now <note n="*" place="margin">The juſt contrary is true.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> was ſo far from requiring Perfect-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it is too manifeſt, that ſome things were in that Law <note n="*" place="margin">The doing things permitted by a Law, is no breach of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law, nor hinders a man from perfectly obeying that Law.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them for the hardneſs of their hearts, which things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excuſed from being ſin, as <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and Licence of divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for leight cauſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. and compared with <hi>Mat. 19. 3. &amp;c.</hi> I conclude therefore, that ſince by

               <p>Yet there are not wanting Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which ſome endeavour to prove this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to be true; and that thence, <hi>Paul</hi> gathered the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of Juſtification by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic-Law.</hi> We will weigh theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments exactly, to try if they have any thing of Solidity, which ought to prejudice ſo plain a truth: They bring two chiefly.</p>
               <p>Their firſt Argument, is taken from that place fore-alleadg'd by me,<note place="margin">Pag. 108.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. Gal. 3. 10. As many as are of the works of the Law, are under a Curſe:</hi> For it is written, <hi>Curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, that doth not continue in all things,</hi> &amp;c. Where, ſay they, it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtle gathers the Impoſſibility of Juſtification by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49565:49"/> the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> from thence that by this Law, no man is free from a Curſe, who hath not obeyed all the commands of this Law perfectly.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is not neceſſary, nor convenient, in the cited place this phraſe [<hi>continue in all things</hi>] ſhould ſignifie moſt Perfect-obedience, or quite ſinleſneſs; ſince ſuch Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is impoſſible to man encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Fleſh; neither doth it ſeem conſentaneous to Divine equity, that any one for the defect of it, ſhould be obnoxious to Eternal Maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore the ſenſe of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemony cited, is this; That every man is Accurſed; that is, is Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Obnoxious to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned by the Law, who doth not do, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve perſevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="*" place="margin">Is not this perfect obedience to a Law, to do all the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be done?</note> all thoſe things which the Law preſcribeth to be obſerved. And he is reputed to do all things, who doth not err from the end of the Law; who keeps ſafe the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts of the Law, or (as others
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49565:49"/> ſpeak) who keeps all thoſe Precepts of the Law, which contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Life; of which ſort are all thoſe Commands which are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Curſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. In a word, who admits nothing into himſelf knowingly, and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Law of God, although he fails in ſomething, either out of Ignorance, or Inadvertency.</p>
               <p>That place, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. being Twin-brother to this, gives great light to this place, <hi>Whoſoever keeps the whole Law, and yet offends in one point, is guilty of all:</hi> That is, is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Puniſhment threatned to the Tranſgreſſors of the Law, <hi>v. 10.

            </q>
            <p>Here he giveth the true and ordinary Interpretation of this place ſo largely, as to take up <hi>pag.</hi> 109. and half <hi>pag.</hi> 110. which is this, He that knowingly allows himſelf in the knowing Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any one Law, is as far from Salvation, as if he kept none; for ſuch a one doth not act ſincerely in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any Law, ſince all Divine Laws
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49565:50"/> have the ſame Author and Authority: Therefore he that knowingly neglects one Law, doth not keep other Laws, becauſe of Gods Authority in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, or becauſe of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but becauſe he hath not that liſt through Temptation to break them; for if he had as much liſt through Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to break them, ſuch a one would break the other Laws. He goes on:</p>
            <q>
               <p>But one may perhaps reply. Grant it, let that place of <hi>James</hi> be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,<note place="margin">Pag. 110.</note> yet the ſame Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will by no means agree to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's ſcope in that place of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Galatians:</hi> For ſince the Apoſtle doth prove all who are of the Law, to be under a Curſe, only by this reaſon; becauſe it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one, that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in all things,</hi> &amp;c. he doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly hint, that no man can continue in all things, or that the Law doth require ſuch perfect obedience, as none can perform.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, I altogether deny that to be hinted, or implyed in the Apoſtle's Argument: Which, that it may be

                  </gap>ver ſpoke word againſt man's being able to fulfil the Law, in all things by Goſpel-Grace, ſo far as it was a Law; that is, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Eternal death, is impoſed us, or ever was impoſed upon Mankind, ſince the fall of the firſt man; yea, he often acknowledges this poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>There remains another Argument of the Adverſaries (of which they boaſt, as being moſt unconquerable) taken out of that famous place, <hi>Deut. 6. 5. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> You may ſee here, ſay they, that the higheſt and perfecteſt love of God, is required of all in the Law.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, They who fight with this Argument, do kill themſelves with their own Sword. For, ſince God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no other love, than what is done with all the Heart and Mind, and with all the Strength; it is manifeſt, that nothing is required of us beſide, or above our ſtrength (our ſtrength, I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49565:51"/> mean, helpt with that meaſure of Grace which God communicates to every one of us in this Life, or is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ready to communicate.)

                     </gap>ent, that a man's culpable Impotency to good, is an Impotency of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, that we have the natural power and ſtrength to do; And whoſoever doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, muſt neceſſarily talk ridiculouſly about ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as theſe in hand.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the thing we can do (or cannot do a thing according to our ſtrength.)</p>
               <p>The truth of this Anſwer, is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed firmly with theſe following Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he will give to his people, that which he requires, <hi>viz.</hi> To cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe their heart, to love him with all their heart, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Becauſe God himſelf witneſſeth, that there were ſome that loved him after this manner; ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Aſah</hi> the King, and all the people, that they ſought the Lord with their whole heart, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 2. We read
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49565:52"/> of <hi>David,</hi> that he followed God with all his heart, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 8. But that is a famous Teſtimony, which the Holy Ghoſt gives concerning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> the King, That he turned to the the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his ſtrength, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes, 2 Kin. 23. 25. viz.</hi> That is ſaid to be done with the whole heart, and whole ſtrength, which a man imploys his chief Thoughts and Endeavours about; even as we ſay, A man is <hi>totus in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris,</hi> wholly in ſtudies that maketh them his chief buſineſs.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I ſhall as ſoon as I have recited all he ſaith of this nature, anſwer the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all; But this of loving God with all the Soul, being ſomething out of the Road, I will anſwer it here. The command of loving God with all the Heart, and Soul, and Strength, muſt be conſidered either ſtrictly (as I ſaid at the beginning) as a Law with it's penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And ſo it requires the utmoſt of a mans natural Ability (and no more, not as much as an Angel's ability reaches to) ſo that if he fails in the leaſt degree of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49565:52"/> this, he fails ſo much of love due to God by this Law, and is under its curſe. It is eſſential to a Law, as a Law, that it require perfect Obedience to it ſelf; and to deny this, would be to deny that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Law requires all that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; any thing ſhort of this, is not all the Law requires. If a man do not love God in as high a degree as this law in this ſenſe requires, he is from under its Bleſſing, and under its Curſe and Condemnation, and cannot poſſibly be Juſtified by this Law in this ſenſe, nor be pardoned by it; for no Law can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly pardon an offence againſt it ſelf. But he may be pardoned by another Law, a Law of Grace. In this ſtrict ſenſe no meer man in this life, not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> himſelf, ever loved God with his whole heart ſo highly as he ought, ſo high as the Law in this ſenſe required; however, me thinks, he ſhould not have pretended it of all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aſa</hi>'s time, but have ſought ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe at leaſt for thoſe words, and that might have brought him to the ſenſe I ſhall now ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe words may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49565:53"/> as the condition of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying-Law made with them for the Merit of Chriſt, then to come; as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with this Goſpel lenity, that if they love God with the prevailing bent of their Souls, or above all other things, they ſhall be pardoned, eſcape the curſe of the Law in its Rigour due. And in this ſenſe, a man loves God with all his Heart, and Soul, as far as God by his Remedying-Law, requires for his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſo obeys the Law taken in this ſenſe perfectly; that is, loves him ſo much as it requires, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Salvation; that doth it thus prevailingly, though he fail in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, he ought to love God by the ſtrict Law, and ſo needs pardon. The meaning is not, that <hi>Aſa</hi> loved God as much as any Law required from him, and ſo needed no pardon, or Chriſt's ſatisfaction, for failing in any degree of love due to, or required by God.</p>
            <p>But to proceed with the next words of the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will add this for a Concluſion to<note place="margin">Pag 112.</note> this Diſpute; This my Opinion of the poſſibility of fulfilling the Law,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49565:53"/> ſo far as it ever was impoſed by God, upon men as a Law, is not a new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Opinion, but an Opinion appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the common Vote of all the Antients, who wrote before the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> Controverſie had muddied the Rivulets of the more pure and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Doctrine. Yea, and <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelf, though otherwiſe too hot in this unhappy Controverſie, did not doubt to confeſs, that God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſſible things; and, in this ſenſe, only what all particular Believers are able to fulfil.</q> Here he cites ſome Antients for this Opinion, that God doth not require what men have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer<note place="margin">Pag. 112, &amp;c.</note> to do; which takes up <hi>pag.</hi> 112, 113, &amp; 114. almoſt.</p>
            <p>I grant, it is apparent they did hold, as I alſo do, that God requires no more than men have the Natural power to do. But yet I dare challenge any to name one, accounted no Heretick, that held this Opinion (that follows by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſequence from the Authors Opinion): That every man (for that follows by conſequence,) or that every man by that meaſure of Grace which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49565:54"/> God communicates to him, or is ready to communicate to him, may for any Impotency in him to the contrary, ſo live as not to fail in any thing the Law requires, ſo far as to ſtand in need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or Chriſts ſatisfaction for ſuch failings. Yea, or this Opinion which he expreſly holds, as you will preſently ſee more fully, <hi>viz.</hi> That after the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Goſpel, or Converſion, men may, for any Impotency on them to the contrary, ſo live as not to ſin at all, as not to fail at all in obedience to the Law; or ſo, as not to do any thing that deſerves, or is by any Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Eternal death.</p>
            <p>He goes on.</p>
            <q>
               <p>From the things which we have<note place="margin">Pag. 114.</note> already ſpoken, I ſuppoſe it to appear plain enough: That the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did not require moſt perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that is, all manner of ſinleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the higheſt degree, under the peril of Eternal death, and ſo that the Apoſtle's Argument is not built upon that Suppoſition. It remains, that we conſider, by what Reaſon the Apoſtle proves his Concluſion.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49565:54"/> Therefore I judg (ſaving honour to better judgments) this Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle, to lean upon two foundations chiefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were guilty of hainous ſins, and ſo obnoxious to Judgment, and Divine anger; this is hinted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Jews</hi> chiefly, and alſo of all who did ſeek Righteouſneſs in the Law (as I ſaid before, in my anſwer to the firſt Objection) in that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. But the ſame is largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated of all without difference, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Where he charges many hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, both upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But that the Context of the whole place may be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, two things are chiefly to be noted, one belonging to the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, another to the Perſons Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for the Accuſation it ſelf, it is to be Noted, that it is not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of ſins, but they are accuſed of ſins more properly ſo called; that is, of hainous ſins, and worthy of Eternal death. This is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49565:55"/> Firſt, out of the words by which the Poſition, [or Affirmation] of the Apoſtle (which was proved in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> and is in this <hi>Chapter</hi> further Demonſtrated) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 9. We have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are all under ſin. Where that Phraſe [<hi>to be under ſin</hi>] manifeſtly ſignifies to be under the dominion of ſin, or to be addicted to hainous ſins; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſuch a one, is ſaid by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to be ſold under ſin, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 14. Secondly, It is apparent out of the whole Context of the Apoſtle, in which all the ſins that are enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, are of a more <note n="*" place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle indeed doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in hainous ſins, and ſo the import of his Argument, <hi>Rom.

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49565:55"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you enquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſons charged by him, they are as well <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as <hi>Jews, v.</hi> 9. 19. 23. but both conſidered as they were before, and without the Grace of the Goſpel, which is even mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from the ſcope of the Apoſtle, whoſe purpoſe it was to ſtir up both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> convinc't of their guilt and miſery, to ſeek and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Grace of the Goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> contends, that both <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> conſidered in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, to be all under ſin. You will Object, But there were ſome, at leaſt amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who liv'd a holy and unblamable life, before the Faith of Chriſt [or, their faith in Chriſt] and a life moſt alien from the Vices which the Apoſtle here reckons up, and from all of the like kind; ſuch as were <hi>Zachary, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, Simeon, Anna,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: I confeſs it; yea, I do not doubt, but amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49565:56"/>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">I dare not affirm this: For then I muſt hold their Salvation, whereas I read, Salvation is of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were without hope, without God in the world. Neither yet da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e I ſay, that none did thus ſincerely.</note> alſo there were ſome who abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Vices here mentioned, and alſo did ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and from their hearts, love and follow (<hi>Coluerunt</hi>) Virtue and Righteouſneſs, ſo far as it was known to them: And both right Reaſon, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf perſwades me to be of this Opinion, who doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely teach it himſelf, <hi>Rom. 2. v.</hi> 14, 15, 26, 27. But becauſe the Objection is made only concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> I will anſwer only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, leaving it yet to the Reader, to accommodate or fit the ſame Anſwer to the <hi>Gentiles (muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis mutandis</hi>) changing what is to be changed.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Pious men amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were very few, and, being compar'd to others, as a drop in the Sea; and therefore the Apoſtle was to take no great notice concerning them: But it was reaſonable, that the great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49565:56"/> ſcarcity of good men ſhould (as one ſpeaks) give its teſtimony to the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroſity of the wicked. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, univerſal ſpeeches of this ſort that the Apoſtle here uſes, do often occurr in Scripture; which yet it is certain, are <note n="†" place="margin">That is, all put for the moſt. This then is to ſay, that the moſt men are guilty of ſins deſerving Eternal death, and needing pardon by Chriſt; but he contradicts this ſence after.</note> 
                  <hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> ſee <hi>John 3. 32. Iſa. 66. 23. Joel 2. 28. Acts 2. 17. Pſal.</hi> 14. 23. &amp; 145. 14, 15. <hi>Phil. 2. 21. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe few that were Righteous under the Law, did not receive their Righteouſneſs from the Law, but they owed it to Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which even before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Goſpel, did (indeed more ſparingly and rarely) put forth it's force through all paſt-Ages. In a word, they were led with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpel, and not of the Law, and ſo deſerved to be accounted with thoſe who are not of the Works of the Law, but are of Faith. Whence the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49565:57"/> ſhews that all the works of Pious men, who ſhine in the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, proceeded not from the Law, but from Faith. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is <note n="†" place="margin">Sure this is too eaſie a word, that it is likely ſuch did commit ſuch a ſin, as to deſerve Eternal death, ſo as to need Chriſt, and Pardon.</note> likely that thoſe few did not ſo carry themſelves through the whole courſe of their lives, but that they ſome time fell into ſome ſins, or into ſome more hainous ſin, and worthy of death; Yea, this is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for certain; <note n="†" place="margin">This doth not prove his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for though theſe did not, yet it is probable, Some did live without any hainous ſin, in his ſenſe, in the whole courſe of their lives, and ſo did not need pardon as to Eternal guilt, by his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men to whom in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and perfect obſervation of the Divine Law, is aſcribed; That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fell into ſome ſins, and thoſe enormous ones, and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Death, as of <hi>Aſa, 2. Chron.</hi> 16. Of <hi>David, 1 Kings</hi> 15. 5. Of <hi>Joſiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 35. 22. And I think, that which follows with the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49565:57"/> Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 23. muſt be interpreted to this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> All have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God. That propoſition ſeems plainly Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, ſo as to except none; imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no man who hath not been guilty of ſome ſins, or of ſome more hainous ſin; either ſome one time, or for ſome time [<hi>Sive aliquando, ſive aliquandiu.</hi>] And this ſeems to be that very thing which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in many places aſſerts; as for Example, 1 <hi>Kings 8. 46. For there is no man who doth not ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 8. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> Which ſpeech, that it ought to be underſtood of ſins properly ſo called; not only of lighter faults, and alſo that it is Univerſal, the very matter ſhews, and the things which are after<note place="margin">Pag. 118.</note> added in that Epiſtle. <hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 12. wherein alſo that is to be noted, that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>Praeter-tenſe;</hi> If we ſay we have not ſinned, <hi>viz.</hi> before the knowledg of the Goſpel; that is to ſay, The holy Apoſtle, would have the Chriſtians to whom
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49565:58"/> he writes, diligently to take heed to themſelves, of the fault of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful mind; And that they would not attribute this, that they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Vices, either to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only to Goſpel-grace. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he doth not ſeem to deny, but that after the knowledg of the Goſpel, and its Grace received, ſome could be without ſin; ſo as the word Sin is taken by him, not ſo as it ſhould ſignifie meer Ignorance, or ſuddain Motions; but thoſe evil acts, which have (<hi>tractum</hi>) a continued courſe (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks) and do not go before deliberation; yea, he doth not obſcurely hint that this is poſſible, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. 1. Where he doth ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exhort Chriſtians not to ſin. Perhaps, one may reply, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the aforeſaid <hi>Chapter, v.</hi> 3. doth uſe the <hi>Preſent tenſe. If we ſay, we have no ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore he implies, That no man even after the Faith of the Goſpel, is free, or can be free from thoſe ſins more properly ſo called. But the anſwer is eaſie,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49565:58"/> for, to have ſin, and to ſin, or to do ſin, do not ſignifie the ſame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to have ſin (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith rightly) is not now to be in ſin, but to be guilty, or to be made guilty for ſins formerly committed, as doth moſt manifeſtly appear from <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. and 15. 22, 24. The ſenſe therefore is; If we ſay that we have not hainouſly ſinned before the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Goſpel, and, becauſe of thoſe ſins, to have been guilty of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, and ſo yet to be guilty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Grace and Mercy of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould Relieve us, we are plainly Lyars, and baſely ingrateful toward the Goſpel, and that Truth which we profeſs.

               <p>It appears from what we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that this is the Sum of the firſt <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the Apoſtle's Argument leans on, <hi>viz.</hi> That both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if you conſider the far greateſt part of them, were plainly under the dominion of ſin, enſlaved<note place="margin">Pag. 119.</note> to moſt filthy Vices.

And ſo all, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without difference, and without acception, were guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. were obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Divine wrath, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death.</p>

            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49565:59"/>
            <p>His great Argument againſt the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Interpretation of the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> That no Law of God requires any more than a man can do (which I grant to be true, but not in his ſenſe) in the ſenſe that he uſeth, it will do ſtrange feats. By the ſame Argument that he proves, that God doth not require his people to be free from their dayly failings (<hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe no man cloathed with fleſh, can live without ſuch) he may prove that any man for any Impotency on him to the contrary, may be free from ſtanding in need of Pardon, or the Blood of Chriſt: thus.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever can live free from any great ſins, deſerving or threatned with Eternal death, can live without need of pardon, or Chriſts ſatisfaction:</p>
            <p>But all men can live free from any great ſins, deſerving or threatned with Eternal death. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is apparent: He may prove his <hi>Minor</hi> thus. If there was any man that could not live without any great ſin threatned with Eternal death, then he is not bound, no Law requires him, to live without ſuch ſin:</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:49565:60"/>
            <p>But, the Law of God requires him to live without ſuch ſin: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Yea: And he might produce <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and others affirming, that though a man may live a little while without Venial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, though yet not long; yet he may live without Mortal ſin, all his life. Yea this Argument will as well prove, the Heathen may live perfect and without ſin, as any elſe. If they do what they can do, what they can do. And it is a contradiction (he ſaith) to ſay otherwiſe. The conſequence he may prove ſtill thus: <hi>That no Law requires any man to do more than he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for ſuch words [Properly ſins, Improperly ſins, Leſs properly ſins, ſins not deſerving Eternal death;] and then ſometime again, ſaying [no Law requires a man to live without them.] It is ſuch ſlippery Diſcourſe, off, and on; That I can but ask Queſtions, to have him clear his meaning in Anſwering; and ſuch Queſtions I would ask, a man ſpeaking obſcurely about Venial-ſins (amongſt which ſome reckon Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) Are theſe, Things, or Entities
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49565:60"/> (that are conſiſtent with truth of Grace, or Sincerity, thoſe <hi>peccata quotidianae incurſionis,</hi> as they are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) forbidden by any Law of God, or not? If you ſhall ſay, as <hi>Lombard, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas, Bellarmine,</hi> that they are not, then they are not Tranſgreſſions of the Law, are not ſins at all, and no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever can be due to, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by them, being no faults, and a man is perfect notwithſtanding them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no way poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain the Catholick Doctrine of mans ability, perfectly to keep the Law, but by denying Venial-ſins, to be forbidden by the Law.</hi> Lib. 4. de Juſtif. Chap. 14.</p>
            <p>Again, may a ſincere Chriſtian ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ask Pardon for theſe ſins of dayly Incurſion? Then they are Sins, and Tranſgreſſions of a Law, or they could not be pardoned, neither could Chriſt be a Sacrifice for them; and then they are threatned with, and deſerve Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death; for a man cannot with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ask pardon for that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God cannot in Juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. There can be no Pardon but of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49565:61"/> Grace, and Mercy, and Favour, and whatſoever God doth of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, He might juſtly not have done it, and ſo might in ſtrict Juſtice not have pardoned, but have condemned us for theſe.</p>
            <p>Shall a man be condemned for theſe, except he repent of his other ſins? <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> maintain that men ſhould be puniſhed with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, for their Venial-ſins (that do not, they ſay, deſerve death Eternal) except they repent. Then they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Eternal death; for He may not ſo much as puniſh a man except he repent, for thoſe things which do not deſerve the Puniſhment; for he may not do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, though men do not repent.</p>
            <p>Will any ſay, though they be not <hi>contra legem,</hi> againſt the Law; yet they are <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ter,</hi> beſides the Law, as many ſay concerning Venial-ſins? I would only ſay, What do you mean? Do you mean that they are neither commanded to commit thoſe ſins of dayly Incurſion, nor forbidden; then they are (as ſome ſay the Ceremonies are) meerly things indifferent.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:49565:61"/>
            <p>If they be not meerly indifferent, will you ſay that the abſtaining from ſuch things is commendable, though not commanded? And ſo ſay, as this Author rightly tells us, the <hi>Phariſaical Jews</hi> held; that thoſe Commands that required Spiritual and inward Holineſs, as the Tenth Command, were not Commands, but Counſels. If ſo, then the abſtaining from ſuch Sins, is a work of Super-erogation; And then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the failing in not doing works of Super-erogation cannot be pardoned, nor need Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It is but caſting a Miſt before the Readers Eyes, ſo often to put in the word Eternal-death; ſaying, they do not deſerve Eternal death. Will he grant that God may juſtly puniſh ſuch ſins with Temporal death, or any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment? I ſee, he will not. His Opinion, and his and <hi>Epiſcopius</hi>'s Argument, that God cannot juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what men cannot do; areas much againſt their deſerving any puniſhment at all. If God do not, as he affirms, require them by any Law to be free from ſuch ſins, then they are not ſins,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49565:62"/> nor deſerve any Penalty. It would then be Injuſtice in God, to make any mans finger or tooth to ake for them. Whereas the Popiſh Schoolmen themſelves do grant, that they do deſerve Temporal puniſhment. Though the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed allows no ground for any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, but either threatens (and be ſure it would not threaten what ſin doth not deſerve) death; yea, Eternal death or nothing. <hi>The wages of Sin is death, the Sting of death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin, the Law.</hi> And, <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all,</hi> &amp;c. Which curſe the Author (as you will after ſee) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, to ſignifie Eternal wrath.</p>
            <p>But to go on with his words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The other thing which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſuppoſes in his Argument, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was no true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Remiſſion of Sins, or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Divine Anger, or Eternal death due to ſins, promiſed in the <hi>Moſaic-Law.</hi> It is manifeſt enough, the Apoſtle had reſpect to this, <hi>ver.</hi> the <hi>20th.</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Chapter (viz.

For though the Sins which were done by Pride, notorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; or, as the Scripture ſpeaks,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49565:63"/> with a high-hand, could be expiated with no Sacrifices, but were puniſhed with death without Mercy or Pardon, except the ſpecial Mercy of God did intervene, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 25, 26. is to be read: Yet, they are not all to be accounted amongſt theſe ſins (as the moſt Learned <note n="†" place="margin">This is the common obſervation of Learned men.</note> 
                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopius</hi> hath moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well obſerved) which are done voluntarily, or are done Spontaneouſly, or, in ſome meaſure, on purpoſe; but they only which are done with an impious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Commands, or with the ſtubbornneſs of a wilful mind. And ſo, they are They, to which the Puniſhment of Death was appointed by God. It is plain, that they that think otherwiſe, are in a manifeſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; as appear's from that, that we ſee, God appointed ſacrifice for ſuch ſins as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Not reſtoring a Pledg; The taking away ſomething from another by Force; The denying of what one found of another's; yea, and that with an Oath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 4. Therefore there was granted Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49565:63"/> in the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> to hainous ſins. But what a kind of Remiſſion? Why, External, Civil, Temporary, and which belonged only to this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
               <p>For the Law, as it was an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordained for the Political Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of civil Society, did promiſe long Life to thoſe who lived ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. and, on the contrary, did threaten violent death to the Tranſgreſſors of it, as we learn out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7.</p>
               <p>But the higheſt Law-giver, the merciful GOD, that all the people might not be exſtirpated with the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments of their ſinning, appointed that ſome moſt atrocious offences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (that did wage open war againſt the Life, and civil Converſe of men, and this Political Theocracy, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, for the defence of which, the <hi>Moſaical-Law</hi> was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; ſuch as Idolatry, Murther, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſhould only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated with death; But, Sacrifices were ſlain for men unclean, or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Sins leſs hainous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49565:64"/> the Puniſhment of Temporary death, which the men deſerved, was transferred upon a Beaſt. Therefore the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Sacrifices, did afford on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Carnal Redemption, in as much as they did, by Divine appointment, free a man indeed from a violent and immature death; but they did afford no remedy againſt death it ſelf. In a word, they did not afford ſuch Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as is conjoyned with the giving of Eternal life: There being no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, made of it.</p>
               <p>The divine Author to the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> had reſpect to this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. Where having ſpoken of the Sacrifices preſcribed in the Law, He denies they could make the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer perfect according to Conſcience, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that is, Free the man from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and Eternal guilt of Sin, in the ſight of God; but they availed only to the Purgation of the Fleſh, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that is, That a man might be Externally freed from Puniſhment, and Corporal death.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then he brings in theſe places, <hi>Heb.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49565:64"/> Chap. 7. 11. 19. Chap.</hi> 10. 1. Where it is affirmed, <hi>The Law made nothing perfect,</hi> and thus proceeds.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In which place, by Perfection, he chiefly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Full and Perfect, that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Abſolution, not only from leighter faults, but from moſt hainous; which he moſt deſervedly denies to be afforded by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It cannot but be manifeſt to him that rightly underſtands theſe things, wherefore it is that the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Juſtification to the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Not becauſe it requires perfect, and ſo impoſſible Obedience as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification, but rather becauſe it grants no Juſtification at all (that is conjoyned with the Donation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life) upon any condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe Premiſes, therefore, the Apoſtle at length draws his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> (which be comprehended under theſe words, <hi>no Fleſh,) can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law of</hi> Moſes, [<hi>in the ſight of God,</hi>] Chap. 3. 20.

               <p>Therefore this whole Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man can be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes, in foro Dei,</hi> in the ſight of God, who is guilty of thoſe Sins to which no Remiſſion, in the ſight of God, is granted by this Law:</p>

            </p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49565:65"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is an Arguing <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> by a great Leap, by ſuppoſing things, according to this Authors way, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz.</hi> That all men are obliged to Eternal Condemnation for their ſins; whereas there is no poſſibility of this: For if thus obliged, let it be asked, By what Law? Now there is no Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, either promiſing Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs upon Obedience, or threatning Future miſery upon Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but only the Goſpel it ſelf. If it ſhall be replied, that all were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Eternal puniſhment for their ſins by the Goſpel, by the Law of Grace, and Pardon revealed in former times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens:</hi> It is ſo abſurd, that I ſhall ſpeak no more to it than I have. Chriſt was ſent to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the Curſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> and not of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is apparent, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in ſuch places as this Author makes it his buſineſs to Reconcile to the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification, ſo as to deny Juſtification by a Law that did promiſe Eternal life, and threaten Eternal death, and required inward and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49565:66"/> ſpiritual Obedience; and therefore he did not ſpeak of the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-Law. <hi>By the deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, For by the Law, is the knowledg of ſin.</hi> He tells us, None can be juſtified by that Law, that Chriſt bore the Curſe of; ſurely then, that Law threatned Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, elſe Chriſt had born, and freed from, only a Temporal Curſe. He ſpeaks of a Law that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed, <hi>Do we make void the Law by Faith, yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did not eſtabliſh this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-Law. And ſaith, the Law is Spiritual, and did not by thoſe words, mean, the Goſpel is Spiritual; but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Law, to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But ſuppoſe all men guilty of Eternal death without any Law, and ſuppoſe the Apoſtle do ſpeak of the Jewiſh Common-wealth-Law; yet this Argument that he aſcribes to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, would be intolerably faulty, and inconcluſive.</p>
            <p>For, ſuppoſe ſome, in Charity to the Author, ſhould think he meant, that the Apoſtle's ſuppoſition is this; That all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49565:66"/> men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are guilty of ſuch ſins, as there was no temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion upon Sacrifice allowed to, by that Law; but all, guilty of them, were without mercy to be cut off by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: Then this Suppoſition would be falſe; for, without doubt, there were many among the <hi>Jews,</hi> not guilty of ſuch ſins. And again, The Argument muſt mean only the denying of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juſtification; and the denying of Eternal here, would not be ſenſe, and is alſo againſt the Author's intention.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, The meaning is, (which is apparently the Author's mind) All are guilty of ſuch Sins, as there is no Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtification promiſed from, by this Law, becauſe it promiſes no Eternal Juſtification at all upon any termes whatſoever. And then, methinks, the Author being a Diſputant, might have had a ſtrong tentation to think, he could have told the Apoſtle how to prove his great deſign eaſier, even by leaving out, and without making uſe of one of the Hypotheſes, or Foundations of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which is this; That all are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (and eſpecially ſince this Author
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49565:67"/> finds it ſuch a difficulty to maintain that all are Sinners, and deſerve Eternal wrath by ſome Law, that he could not maintain it if there ſhould be found, ſome man that never committed a very groſs ſin in all his life, and therefore ſuppoſes that every man hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one at leaſt.) And ſo by arguing thus: No man, be he guilty, or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, can be juſtified as to Conſcience, or as pertaining to Eternal life, or death, by a Law that neither promiſes Eternal life to the Obedient, or threatens Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death to the Diſobedient:</p>
            <p>But the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Eternal life to any man Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor threatned Eternal death to any Diſobedient:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> No man, Guilty or Innocent, can be juſtified as to Conſcience, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things, by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> might according to the Author, thus be defended: It is true, there are, it may be, ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the <hi>Moſaic-writings,</hi> that command Spiritual obedience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Eternal life upon Obedience, and threaten Eternal death for Sin: But
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49565:67"/> theſe are the Goſpel it ſelf, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in <hi>Moſes</hi> Writings, and men might be, and were Juſtified as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by this. And that is not it, that is meant by the Law in theſe Diſputes, of denying Juſtification by the Law, but only the Jewiſh Common-wealth-Law.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if this be true, that the Law the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no Juſtification as to Eternal, or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerns, upon any terms whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; the Argument would not only have run eaſier and better, without any mention of all being Sinners: But ſuch mention, in that caſe, would be vain and idle (yea and falſe, if given as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they were not Juſtified by ſuch a Law as to Conſcience): For the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of men, could not be in the leaſt any reaſon at all, why men are not Juſtified as to Future life, by a Law that promiſed no ſuch Juſtification if they had obeyed; But the Law's not promiſing it, is all the cauſe poſſible.</p>
            <p>But to go on with the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Hence moreover the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer's, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ought
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49565:68"/> to flee to another Covenant of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mercy,</q> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> that Covenant eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, in which there is promiſed, not only Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but Eternal Redemption, and <q>Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. and 9. 12. and a moſt full and perfect Remiſſion of all Sins, even the moſt hainous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the donation of Eternal life, to all thoſe who ſhall from Faith in Chriſt, repent heartily of thoſe ſins, and give up themſelves to God, and a holy Life. And here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth urge that upon both <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> which other-where he had ſeriouſly preſſed upon the <hi>Jews</hi> chiefly, in theſe words, <hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. Be it known therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Brethren, that by him there is is Preached to you the Remiſſion of ſins; And by him every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſhall be juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. Where the Apoſtle ſeems to affirm two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only, that Spiritual Remiſſion of Sins (which the Law granted not at all) was Preached
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49565:68"/> through Jeſus; But that every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhould be Juſtified by him from all ſins, from which no man could ſo much as carnally be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hitherto, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Argument of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He might have ſaid, Hitherto of all that hath any ſhew, that he ſaith of the Apoſtle's meaning. And I will add hitherto, I have tranſlated him, ſince I begun with his Argument, almoſt at leaſt, <hi>verbatim;</hi> But in going forward, will bind my ſelf to do it no further, ſince this firſt Argument is all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he brings, that can with any fairneſs, be pretended to be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Argument, to exclude Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Law, and works of the Law. I will relate the ſubſtance of his other Arguments, which is all he pretends to be the Apoſtle's, and the relating and expatiating upon which, takes up the reſt of his Book almoſt wholly, I will alſo relate all ſuch Paſſages, as have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable ſhew, to ſupport his Expoſition of the Apoſtles words in ſuch places, as this Book is Written
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49565:69"/> to Reconcile to Saint <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The other Argument of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which equally hath reſpect to the whole Law, whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle clearly proves the Impoſſibility of Juſtification by the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> is taken from another defect of this Covenant, from the defect of Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Auxiliary Grace; even as the Old Law indulged no full and perfect pardon to paſt ſins, ſo neither did it ſupply ſufficient aid for the avoiding of Future ſins. The Apoſtle is much in this Argument, ſhewing the Law was very Infirm in it ſelf, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of ſtrength, whereby mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men might be drawn from the dominion of ſin, and from an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Cuſtom of ſinning, to true and ſaving Righteouſneſs, or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Argument from a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Law, to ſanctifie men (ſuppoſe it true, which is indeed true of the Law, as the Common-wealth-Law, but not when the Law is uſed in the ſenſe wherein it was the Goſpel, or Law of Grace; for then this Diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49565:69"/> can only be affirmed, at the moſt, comparatively to this clear Diſpenſation ſince Chriſt) and conſequently that Sanctification muſt be by ſome Grace and Favour of the Spirit; would by no means prove Juſtification to be of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace, or Favour, or by Pardon. For ſuppoſe that God ſhould by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, take ſome effectual courſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a man wholly free from ſin; this Sanctification of a man would be free, and of Grace, and Favour, but not his Juſtification; but that would be of Works, and the Law in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of it, ſo as not to be of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or of Mercy and Pardon. The Sanctification of the humane Nature of Chriſt; was of Grace and Favour, and by ſpecial Diſpenſation: but his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was of Debt by the Law, and of Juſtice in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and not of Grace, or Mercy, or Pardon, or by Imputation of Righteouſneſs, to one unrighteous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtle doth not any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to my remembrance (though it may have a true meaning in a very remote ſenſe) much leſs in any of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49565:70"/> places propounded to be reconciled to St. <hi>James,</hi> make uſe of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That Sanctification is of Grace and Mercy, therefore Juſtification is ſo, and not of Works, or Debt. So that whether it be a good Argument or no, it is not the Apoſtle's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Author ſeems now in the proſecution of this Argument, not to keep Juſtification, or Sanctification, or the grace and favour of Juſtification, and Sanctification, diſtinct, as he hath done hitherto; one being the working a real change (I mean real in oppoſition to a Law, or relative change) in the Soul; and conſiſting in the favour of Converting a man: The other being a Law-Act, and conſiſting in acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or abſolving a man from an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. He ſeems to forget that he had <hi>pag.</hi> 8, 9. well and convincingly confuted the Opinion of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who herein <hi>Symbolizing</hi> with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> affirm's that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> by Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, means not in a Law-ſenſe abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin, but Sanctification, or Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Vices; whereas there is not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49565:70"/> one place where the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to juſtifie, is uſed where it ſo ſignifies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Rev. 22. 11. He that is righteous, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, let him be further ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified ſtill:</hi> And concerning this place, the Author ſaith it is probable, and it is alſo affirmed by <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, that it ſhould be there read, according to ſome antient Manuſcripts, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>let him do righteouſneſs ſtill.</hi> Now, as I ſaid, this Author ſeems to forget this in the whole proſecution of this Argument, as, for Example, when <hi>pag.</hi> 253. he will have the meaning of thoſe words [<hi>Tit. 3. v.</hi> 7. That being <hi>juſtified freely by his Grace</hi>] to be, that being <hi>enabled</hi> by the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, to do thoſe things to which Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is promiſed: Which is, in effect, to ſay, being juſtified by the Grace of Sanctification; or, being juſtified by the gracious operation of the Holy Ghoſt in Sanctifying. Which alſo is an Interpretation alien from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words. The meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, as may appear to any, peruſing the words foregoing; That, having the Goſpel-condition wrought in us, by the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49565:71"/> operation of the Holy Ghoſt, being Regenerated, we might be juſtified by his Grace, that is, by his Grace in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning; not by the gracious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit in Sanctifying. For though the Grace and Favour of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, be aſcribed frequently to the Spirit as it's peculiar operation, yet not the grace and favour of Juſtification; but is peculiarly aſcribed to God the Father, as Judg and Rector, being a Law-Act. <hi>It is GOD that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The Law had a defect of ſtrength to Sanctifie men: Why? Becauſe it wanted External help, neceſſary to work true Sanctification; and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal help, neceſſary to work true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. It wanted an External help, neceſſary to work true Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>viz.</hi> it wanted a promiſe of Eternal life, to encourage men to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it: It wanted an Internal help, neceſſary to work Sanctification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanted the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the firſt, It wanted this External help, to work true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49565:71"/> in that the Promiſes, and Threatnings of this Law, wherein the ſtrength of every Law lies, were only Temporal and Earthly, and men might eaſily contemn theſe. Thoſe Earthly good things, would not much move the mind of an intelligent man. Yea, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that it contained only Earthly Promiſes and Threats, was in it's own Nature apt to beget in men a baſe and ſordid Temper; yea, a Temper plainly alien from true Piety. The chief parts of Piety, are the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſelf, bearing the Croſs, dayly Prayer, Meditation on the Life-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and a moderate and a ſober uſe of the good things of this Life. But how could it be that this Law, that bound their minds only to Earthly profits, and worldly delights, ſhould work ſuch Piety in men? And hence it cometh to paſs, that the Precepts of this Law, were much a Kin to the Promiſes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Earthly.</p>
            </q>
            <p>He then brings-in Scripture, to prove this defect, but none of them out of places where the Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49565:72"/> Juſtification by Works, and by the Law, but theſe two (which I cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſhew his meaning by the Law,) <hi>Gal. 3. 13. The Law is not of Faith, but he that doth them, ſhall live in them:</hi> And gives this as the meaning; The Law did not promiſe ſuch things, as that a man did need Faith, which is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen, to believe them, <hi>viz.</hi> It promiſed only things of Senſe, not of Faith, <hi>Gal. 3. 21. If there had been a Law which could have given life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by that Law.</hi> And ſuppoſes the meaning to be, that the fault was in the Law, not in the Men; for if the Law had promiſed it, men would have attained Life by that Law. Whereas the very next words of the Apoſtle, are, <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin,</hi> &amp;c. implying, it was through ſin, and mens default they did not attain life by that Law; which could not be if the Law there ſpoken of, promiſed no ſuch thing to the Obedient.</p>
            <p>And he after tells us, that in the ſenſe wherein the Law had any Spiritual commands, or Threatnings, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49565:72"/> of a Future life, it was <hi>Ipſiſſimum Evangelium,</hi> the very Goſpel it ſelf: And that the Apoſtle never made que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about it, taken in this ſenſe; which is in effect to ſay. That the Apoſtle never ſpoke againſt Juſtification by the Law in any ſenſe, wherein it threatned Eternal death, or promiſed Eternal life; Nor, in any ſenſe wherein mans ſins hinder his Juſtification by it: And alſo it is to ſay, that no man is, or ever was Condemned by the Law, as to Eternal condemnation, in any ſenſe wherein the Law is diſtinct from the Goſpel; And that Chriſt never ſatisfied for the breach of any Law different from the Goſpel, that threatned Future death; much leſs for the breach of any Law, that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Spiritual, or Internal obedience: And alſo, That no man is pardoned, by Chriſt and the Goſpel, the breach of any Law that threatned Future death. But I have already, even in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Diſcourſe, ſhewed both the inevitableneſs, and abſurdity, of theſe Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe many maintain this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Author for ſubſtance,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49565:73"/> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the Promiſes, and Threats of the Law, were only Temporal and Earthly, and ſo could not work in men true Piety. As <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> &amp;c. Though in ſomething diſagreeing from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the way of <note n="*" place="margin">I confeſs Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> ſeems not careful to evade difficulties at all, but ſeems peremptory in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any but Temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, till Chriſts time. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſ. pag.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.</note> their evading the difficulties their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a growing Opinion, and ſeems to me very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, I will here ſpeak largely againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I grant, The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had no Spiritual commands (meaning by Spiritual, as this Author doth, obliging the inward man, the Thoughts, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) nor Threats, or Promiſes, of Life-to-come Puniſhments or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as it was the Jewiſh Political-Law, or the Inſtrument of the Jewiſh Polity. But this cannot be meant by the Law in thoſe Paſſages in debate, to be reconciled to <hi>James:</hi> For it is apparent (and this Author grants it) that mens ſinfulneſs is given by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49565:73"/> as the cauſe, why men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Juſtification, as to Future life, by the Law: But mens ſinfulneſs, could be no cauſe why none were Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to Conſcience, and Future-life by the Law, in this Political ſenſe; ſince it would not have Juſtified any as to Conſcience, and Future-life, had they been altogether innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How notoriouſly contrary it is to <hi>David</hi>'s, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſſions, concerning the Jewiſh Law, to deny, it had, in any ſenſe, Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itual Commands, or Promiſes, or Threats of Life-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Reward or Puniſhment? <hi>Pſal. 1. 2. The Godly man's delight, is in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate day and night.</hi> Pſal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſoul. The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple:</hi> He meant not only <hi>wiſe</hi> for this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ver. 8. The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord is pure, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eyes; True and Righteous alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, more to be deſired than Gold</hi> (whereas Gold was worth a Temporal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49565:74"/> Inheritance in <hi>Canaan) ſweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-comb. By them is thy ſervant warned, and in keeping them, there is great reward:</hi> He means greater than this world can afford, or elſe it was not very great. Pſal. 119. 18. 20. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wonderous things out of thy Law. My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to thy Judgments at all times.</hi> Ver. 111. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as a heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> That theſe things were ſpoken of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; nothing elſe, that could pretend to the Name of the Law of God, being then written; And it is equally appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Theſe things could not be truly ſpoken of a Law that had neither Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Precepts, nor Future Promiſes, or Rewards. And ſure, none will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>David</hi>'s working-Fancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited ſuch things of the Law, as was not true of it; for then he would have been too blame: And alſo theſe phraſes, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, and, The Holy Ghoſt ſaith, are uſed as <hi>Equipollent</hi> terms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 7. compared, <hi>Pſal</hi> 16.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49565:74"/> 
               <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the Path of Life; in thy Preſence, is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right Hand, there are pleaſures for evermore. David,</hi> that thus ſpeaks, tell's us, He learned his Wiſdom and Underſtanding, from his Meditation on the Law. Further, leſt any ſhould conceit, that <hi>David</hi> was a man wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully panting after the Word, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the Law only, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of worldly Promiſes, therein made to the Righteous; Let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 14. he allows wicked men to have great things in this life, calling them, <hi>Men of this world, which have their portion in this life, whoſe belly thou filleſt with hid treaſures, they are full of Children, and leave the reſidue of their ſubſtance to them.</hi> In the following <hi>Verſe,</hi> he diſtinguiſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from theſe, as appears by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis, <hi>ver. 15. [as for me</hi>] ſaying, <hi>As for me, I will behold thy Face in Righteouſneſs. I ſhall be ſatisfied, when I awake, with thy Likeneſs.</hi> So Pſal. 49. 6. <hi>They that truſt in their Wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their Riches,</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Death ſhall feed on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49565:75"/> them,</hi> &amp;c. Then follows by way of Antitheſis, <hi>ver. 15. But God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem my ſoul from the power of the grave, for he ſhall receive me.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Law is Holy, Juſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Good. The Law is Spiritual, but I am Carnal.</hi> Call's it the Commandment that was unto Life, and means Eternal life. <hi>I delight in the Law of God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inward man.</hi> How unlike are theſe Encomium's to the reviling Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, this Author gives to the whole <hi>Moſaic</hi>-Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were only Carnal, and Temporal, and ſo men could not poſſibly be drawn to true Piety by them; Then no man was bound to true Piety by that Law: For no man is bound to natural Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; Then it was not men's fault that they were not made truly Pious by that Law. For it is naturally neceſſary as a Foundation of true Religion, as to believe that God is; ſo to believe that He is a Rewarder after this life, of them that diligently ſeek him here.</p>
            <p>Yea further, If the Law, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith, was apt in it's own Nature,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49565:75"/> to beget in men a ſordid Temper, and Minds alien from true Piety; then the Jewiſh people were bound to have ſuch Tempers, and Minds alien from true Piety: And if the Law did bind mens minds to earthly Profits, and worldly Delights, they did well in ſuffering themſelves to be thus bound by it: For they ought to yield to God's Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God would not have been angry with the people for not being w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought to true Piety by the Law: For they would have been fully excuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> No man would have been obliged to Future miſery, or wrath to come by that Law, that had no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Future miſery; and alſo Chriſt never bare any Future-life curſe, or any thing by way of Satisfaction, as to a Future-life curſe; Nor could any be pardoned their Tranſgreſſions of the Law, as to Future puniſhment, when the Law threatned no Future Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Theſe Threats, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning a Future life, were at leaſt ſo plain, as that people might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them; elſe what I have ſaid,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49565:76"/> equally follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man was bound to true Piety by them, nor could be juſtly Condemned, for not being wrought to true Piety by them, for they would be in ſuch a caſe excuſable. No man is bound to know, what he hath a natural Impotency to the knowing of. None will ſay, God can juſtly be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at, or condemn the <hi>Heathen,</hi> for not knowing, and underſtanding the Doctrine of Chriſt, that they had not the means naturally neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Yea, the Law of God was ſo plain, that the ſimple, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. (even plain ordinary people, that were no <hi>Rabbies</hi>) and young men, might, with ſuch helps as God afforded them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; elſe they, at leaſt, had been excuſable, and could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for not being truly Pious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> ordinarily did believe the Law, promiſed Future life, and threatned Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by all the old Jewiſh <note n="*" place="margin">Their <hi>Talmud,</hi> naming three ſorts of men, that ſhould have no portion in the World to come, nameth them for one ſort, that ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49565:76"/> by them as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi> that denied Future happineſs to the Obedient, and miſery to the Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. <hi>Targum Onkelos,</hi> on <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. paraphraſeth the place thus. <hi>If a man doth them, he ſhall live in them, with Eternal life.</hi> Targum Jonathan, thus, <hi>Which if a man do, he ſhall live with Eternal life, and his portion ſhall be with the Righteous. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therein you ſeek to have Eternal life,</hi> Acts 24. 14, 15. I believe all things written in the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and have hope toward God; which they themſelves allow, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, both of the Juſt, and Unjuſt. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> errour, in denying a Future life, was occaſioned (as Chriſt tells us) by their not underſtanding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, meaning the Old Teſtament, then only written, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 24. which could not be ſaid, if the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed no ſuch things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Law had promiſes of Future-life Happineſs. Let any tell me, What a promiſe of Future-life is, if this be not one, <hi>viz.</hi> A notification

It is ſaid of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> aliens to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were without hope (that is, of Future happineſs) being ſtrangers to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Promiſe, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had. Which at leaſt implies, 1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> had promiſes of a Future-life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs. 2. That they had clearer promiſes of a Future life, than the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49565:77"/> 
               <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And 3. What they had more of this Hope, was to be aſcribed to the Covenant of Promiſe, revealed in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Rom. 9. 4.

And wherein did God do more for them, in giving them his Statutes, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than for any other Nation? Many in the world, had greater Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Profits, and Pleaſures, than how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Canaan. Luke</hi> 16. 28. Where, to the Rich man in Hell, deſiring to have <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſent to his Brethren, to tell them of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſery of the wicked, and the Future happineſs of the Obedient; it was anſwered, They have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, let them hear them; and if they will not hear them, neither would they be perſwaded, if one ſhould riſe from the dead; which could not have been ſaid, if the Old Teſtament-Scriptures had revealed no ſuch things: Yea, they would have been excuſable
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49565:78"/> in not being moved with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, to ſeek Future-life, and to eſcape Future-death, if there was no ſuch thing revealed, ſo as they could underſtand it by the helps, that were Miniſtred to them, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> from a Child (by the help of his Mother, and Grand-Mother) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſo far, without doubt, as was neceſſary to Salvation, and then be ſure, ſo far as to know there was a Future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed to the Obedient) which were able to make him wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not meerly wiſe to attain a Temporal reward in this life, <hi>ver. 16. All Scripture is profitable for Doctrine, for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs:</hi> That the man of God (<hi>i. e.</hi> a Miniſter) may be perfect, throughly inſtructed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work; this is ſpoken of the Old Teſtament-Scripture.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, do Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Life promiſed to the Obedient in the Law, as reaching to Future life, <hi>Lev. 18. 5. The man that doth theſe Commands, ſhall live in them.</hi> Ezek. 20. 11. <hi>I gave them my Statutes, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49565:78"/> if a man do, he ſhall live in them.</hi> Gal. 3. 12. The Apoſtle cites theſe words: and by <hi>Life,</hi> takes it as a thing granted, that they meant Eternal life. Alſo <hi>Rom. 7. 10. The Commandment that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life:</hi> Mat. 19. 16, 17. <hi>The young man asks, What ſhall I do to inherit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Which ſhew, that Life, and Eternal life, ſignifie the ſame, <hi>Pſal, 16. ult. Thou wilt ſhew me the way of life, in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy; and, at thy right hand, are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Life here alſo ſignifies the Future life.</p>
            <p>There are frequent Promiſes, That if they will keep his Commandments, He will be their God. The Apoſtle cites, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. Where it is ſaid, <hi>If you will walk in my Statutes, and keep my Judgments, and do them; then I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people,</hi> Ver. 3. 12. Which was Gods part of the Covenant, his Engagement made to the people at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as appears, <hi>Ver.</hi> 46. Now the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cited this Promiſe, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49565:79"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. adds, <hi>Having theſe Promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſhews, That he underſtood theſe words, of Gods being one's God, to extend to Future happineſs. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31, 32, 33. Have you not read concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead? <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac: Now God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. So <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 26. By the words tranſlated, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, in <hi>Mat.</hi> and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in <hi>Mark,</hi> ſeems to be meant Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, only <note n="†" place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31. well clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this was that which the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied (as well as other things, conſequential thereto, and of leſs concernment, to ſupport this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion): And this was a moſt wicked Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſubverting virtually all Religion, which cannot be ſaid of an Opinion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denying the Reſurrection of the Body, provided a man did but hold a Future-ſtate of being, or ſubſiſtence of the Soul in happineſs, or miſery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49565:79"/> to a mans works in this life: But ſuch an erronious Opinion might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be held, (for any thing I can ſee to the contrary) in thoſe more dark times, conſiſtent with this foundation of true Religion; that God is a Rewarder, in a Future life, of Obedience in this; and Puniſher of Diſobedience. And further, I do not think that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, was ſo clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Old Teſtament, as that one, believing all the Books of it to be Divine, might not yet hold it a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Point; conſidering the difficulties that <hi>Oppugne</hi> it, and the obſcurity of the Scriptures affirming it; Though none of competent underſtanding, believing the New Teſtament, can now doubt of it. Now our Saviour's Argument drawn from theſe words, <hi>I am the God of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>and of</hi> Iſaac, &amp;c. ſince this was ſpoken to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> were dead; is cogent to prove (againſt the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dational wicked Opinion of the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) viz.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> were then in being, and alſo in Being in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; for, had they been utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49565:80"/> or in beeing, but in no eſtate of happineſs, He could not have ſaid, <hi>I am the God,</hi> but only, at the moſt, <hi>I was the God of</hi> Abraham. He is not ſo much as the Suſtainer, as the God, in ſuch a low-ſenſe, <hi>of the dead,</hi> viz. of men totally extinct; <hi>but of the living,</hi> viz. of men in actual being. And He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called the God (which implies ſome wonderful, great, and infinite fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) of men, being indeed, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting after their death, but being in miſery, and dead in the ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Law threatned Future death; But only can be called a God to ſuch men departed, as are in being, and alſo are in great happineſs, and ſo are alive in the ſenſe, the Law promiſed Future life.</p>
            <p>Alſo Saint <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 22. 3, 4, 7. citeth that very Scripture fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz. Lev.</hi> 26. 11, 12. Where God promiſes from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that if they would obey his Voice, <hi>he would be their God</hi> (It appears, He refers to this very Scripture, by the foregoing words in both places, of ſetting his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle amongſt them.) And he interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49565:80"/> the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>of God's being one's God,</hi> by expreſſions, denoting Life-to-come happineſs, As wiping away all tears; And death being no more, <hi>ver. 7. He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God.</hi> And alſo, the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, Chap.</hi> 11. 14, 15, 16. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain's this phraſe, <hi>of God being one's God.</hi> All theſe dyed in the Faith, not having received the Promiſes, but, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen them afar off, were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them; and declared plainly, by confeſſing themſelves Pilgrims and Strangers, that they ſought a Country, and that not meerly <hi>Canaan,</hi> an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Country, but a Heavenly: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not aſhamed to be called their God; For he hath prepared for them a City (meaning Heaven, of which <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were but Types:) Implying, that if that phraſe of being their God, had meant no more than giving them temporal good things in <hi>Canaan,</hi> it would have been a ſhamefully too high a word, for ſo low a thing, and that giving only ſuch low things as temporal Mercies
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49565:81"/> are, would have been unworthy of that Appellation, <hi>of God being their God:</hi> So that God might have been aſhamed of uſing ſo Emphatical a Speech, in ſuch a low ſignification. But he is therefore not aſhamed of ſo high a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Friendſhip as thoſe words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſince He builded for them a City, not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Theſe following, are the only colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able replys made by ſome, or that can be made here, that I can call to mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It would be to no purpoſe to reply, The Old Teſtament had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or Threats, of Life-to-come hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or miſery; but, it typified Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threats, of Life-to-come happineſs, or miſery:</p>
            <p>For firſt, I ſuppoſe I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, it had Life-to-come Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threats.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the ſenſe wherein it did typifie ſuch Life-to-come good, or evil things, it had no Life-to-come Promiſes or Threats; elſe, it would typifie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſuch F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture-good things, in promiſing thoſe Future-good things,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49565:81"/> which would be ridiculous to affirm.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the ſenſe wherein it did typifie Life-to-come things, it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtrict Law of Works, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perfect obedience, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Future miſery, and promiſing Future happineſs thereon; Nor the Law of Grace or the Goſpel, promiſing Pardon as to Conſcience, and Future happineſs upon repentance and ſincere Obedience, but the Jewiſh political Law. And it is a palpable miſtake, though common to ſay otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reply, That God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Life and Death eternal, by the words uſed in the promiſes and threats, but the people could not ſo underſtand them, though they uſed their utmoſt integrity and diligence, Is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: For then they would have been excuſable, and it would not have been ſaid, <hi>they have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> &amp;c. And I have made it apparent, the people did ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is irrational to reply as ſome. We grant the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> did believe, God would give Eternal life to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49565:82"/> the obedient, but God never promiſed it to them: Thus <hi>Socinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, Then they were to blame to believe it, if God never made any Notification of his Will, that it ſhould be ſo, It was then an Irrational fooliſh act for them when tortured, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deliverance, that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a better Reſurrection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We read they believed and embraced the Promiſes of Future<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life happineſs. So that, they had ſuch Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and there was no more in their Faith, than in the Divine promiſe; no more in their Subjective, than in their Objective faith; than in the Revelation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is to affirm, that if they did well in thus believing, That they gave God, what was none of his own; gave to God what they had no power or ability from him to do, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what God never ſaid, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for what God had never promiſed. This would be, To Supererogate in Faith and Hope, if it was but well done of them. But, to avoid ſuch Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49565:82"/> we muſt ſay, that ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would not have been acceptable to God, but a fooliſh, ſinful, irrational act: As it would be in a man now, to believe, and hope that if he ſerve God here, he ſhall have a fair Houſe built in the Moon, to dwell in for ever, when God hath made no Revelation, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The moſt rational and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reply poſſible of them that deny Life-to-come Promiſes, in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Writings, would be this: (though apparently falſe, and I know not of any that uſe it) That the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt, had ſuch Promiſes of Future-life happineſs, and ſo were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Piety; but they were revealed only by the light of Nature, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and not in the Scriptures. And that the <hi>Jews</hi> erred in looking for Eternal life from the Scriptures; For the Old Teſtament Scriptures were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written for the Common-wealth Temporal-Law, and to typifie Soul and Conſcience-concernments; but did not ſo far intermedle with Conſcience-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, as to threaten Future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49565:83"/> to any ſin; or to promiſe Eternal, or Future happineſs, on any Terms whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But 1. I have proved, they had ſuch Promiſes in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2. They had need of their Reaſon and Faculties, and of the Light and Law of Nature, and of all helps they had to underſtand theſe things in their Scripture; as we have alſo yet, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Writings, both of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>3 I do hold, and could prove it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently from the Scripture, That there were, and are, ſome diſcoveries by the Light of Nature, and Works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not only of the ſtrict Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, making Future miſery due to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, and Future happineſs to perfect Obedience; But alſo of the Goſpel, or Law of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> that God was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and that there was place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that God would receive ſinners to Future favour and happineſs, by pardoning their ſins upon Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſincere Obedience. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, The <hi>Heathens</hi> did ordinarily maintain this; and without doubt it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49565:83"/> was not their Errour. And this they might gather from their beholding the preſent goodneſs of God to them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their incorrigibleneſs in great ſins, in giving them Rain, and fruitful Seaſons, and filling their Hearts with Food and Gladneſs. Yea, they had ſo much Light, as to make them Inexcuſable, and Condemnable in not Repenting; which could not be if there was no Notification of his Will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to Future-life favour upon Repentance; but rather (as ſome hold) were bound to believe that there was no forgiveneſs with him, no Future reward or happineſs Notified by ſuch goodneſs of God, in his Providence to men that were ſinners, and did need Repentance. Though I think the Scripture offers us ground to believe, That this way of Revelation, enough for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, did not, (yet through their own wickedneſs) effectually prevail to turn any man throughly from ſin to God, or to cauſe ſuch Repentance to Life, as in its own Nature it dictated; any man I mean, that had no more or further Revelation from God. Now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49565:84"/> if they had ſuch Diſcoveries, theſe are as properly Promiſes of a Future-life, and threatnings of Future-death as thoſe written.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is apparent, that there was more cleer and convincing Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Future-life happineſs to the Obedient, and miſeries to the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in the Old Teſtament-Scriptures, than in the Law of Nature, and Book of Providence. The Law was given that the Offence might abound, and doth not only diſcover Duties, and Sins known by the light of Nature more cleerly, but the great danger of ſin, and happineſs that comes by obedience, more convincingly: yea; this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Future-life happineſs, ſo much the more cleerly; that the Diſcoveries made to the <hi>Heathen</hi> of this, was no diſcovery comparatively, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at leaſt in thoſe words, <hi>Aliens from the Covenants of Promiſe, without hope.</hi> And thoſe words, <hi>they have</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. teach us, that there they were taught Future miſery due to ſinners, and Future happineſs to the Obedient, as convincingly, as if
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49565:84"/> one roſe from the dead, to tell them of them. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the written Law, and therefore of the Old Teſtament-Law, as the <hi>norma judicii,</hi> as the rule of the Future judgment to them that lived under it, <hi>Rom. 2. 12. As many as have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without Law</hi> (meaning, written Law) <hi>ſhall periſh without Law; And as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law; (viz.</hi> at the Future judgment, as appears by the following words) Judged, that is, Juſtified or Condemned at the laſt day by the Law, which could not be, if the Law promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no Future-life, or threatned no Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-death. Alſo, by the Law, he means, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as appears by the following words, <hi>ver. 17. Thou art called a</hi> Jew, <hi>and reſteſt in the Law;</hi> and by the words [<hi>until the Law;</hi>] And [<hi>until</hi> Moſes] being uſed as equivalent terms by this Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13, 14. compared.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It would be in vain for any to reply here, as the Author of the Book called <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> doth, who having ſaid, <hi>Part 1. pag.</hi> 26. <q>That the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49565:85"/> between the two Covenants, is this, That the old Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> had Temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; But the Goſpel, Eternal.</q> And one in Anſwer to this Book, replying, that this is contrary to the ſeventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which ſaith. <q>They are not to be heard, who ſay, the Fathers looked for no more than Tranſitory promiſes, (Meaning things Promiſed.)</q> In his Appendix to the third Part, <hi>pag.</hi> 150. He rejoyns, <q>I never thought that the Fathers looked for no more than Tranſitory promiſes; but, that it was not by virtue of the Covenant made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they looked for more; I did, and do affirm. A great many of the Worthies mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. lived before the Law was given; and the reſt that followed them, built their Expectation on the ſame ground they did.</q> Which alſo ſeems to be Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi>'s opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were Promiſes of Future-life made to the more Ancient Patriarchs, but none in the <hi>Moſaic</hi>-Diſpenſation.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:49565:85"/>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Almoſt all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have uſed, do convincingly prove this, That the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> promiſed Future-life, as well as threatned Future-death. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Author holds the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> threatned Future-life-death to any ſin, or not, I know not, but think I have proved both ſufficiently. Alſo, the Threats of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, are expreſſed in as temporal a ſtile, as the Promiſes: ſo, it would be irrational, to affirm it threatned Future-death, but promiſed not Future-life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The promiſes made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> were made in as temporal a ſtile, as thoſe in the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> if not in a far more temporal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it ſhall be urged (for I know, the miſunderſtanding of ſuch paſſages, occaſions this miſtake) that thoſe Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are Interpreted in the New Teſtament, as apparently reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Future-life. I anſwer, So are the Promiſes of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> made with the <hi>Jews, Rom. 7. 10. Chap. 10. 5, 6, 7, 2 Cor. 6. 16. Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49565:86"/> And alſo the Threats.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ſeems apparent to me, that that Diſpenſation of the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> was a clearer Diſpenſation of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Future-death to the Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and Promiſes of Future Soul-life to the Obedient, than that to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You cannot with any colour reply, It is true, there are Promiſes of Future-life, and Threatnings of Future<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>death (as this Author ſomewhere grants, but virtually, and often unſays it again) in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, but not in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for theſe Promiſes and Threats were Goſpel, in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have ſpoken againſt this Opinion enough already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some you ſee, deny any ſuch Promiſes in the Jewiſh Law, And ſome any ſuch Promiſes or Threats, in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If this was true, it would follow, That Chriſt never ſatisfied for any more, than a temporal Curſe of the Law: For I have ſhewed the obſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, of ſaying that he ſatisfied for the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49565:86"/> Curſe of the Goſpel in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings threatned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Law, in a ſenſe diſtinct from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, wherein it had Spiritual commands, and that to Life, meaning Eternal-life, and alſo Future life Threats; ſaying, Chriſt hath born the Curſe of the Law for us. So <hi>Rom. 3. 20. By the deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight: For by the Law is the knowledg of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, that I may conclude from what hath been here ſaid, that the utmoſt that can be ſaid in derogating from the Law, is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it was the Common-wealth Law, had no Eternal Promiſes, or Threats, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Commands. And in this ſenſe are many Scriptures, produced by this Author to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Old Teſtament-Law diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken in the Important ſenſe, as refering to Conſcience, and Soul-ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or damnation, both in the ſenſe wherein it was the Original-law of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49565:87"/> Works; And alſo in the ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was the Goſpel, or a Law of Grace and Pardon, hath no ſuch cleer and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Promiſes of Eternal-life, and threatnings of Eternal-death, as are in the New Teſtament-Scriptures. And in this comparative ſenſe, may ſome places of Scripture ſpeaking in extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Law-promiſes be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as being no Spiritual promiſes, or Promiſes of Heaven, comparatively to theſe in the New Teſtament: And multitudes of Inſtances may be brought, of Scriptures denying poſſitively, and yet to be underſtood only compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
            <p>As for Inſtance: That place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. where we read, that Chriſt hath brought Life, and Immortality to light, through this clearer Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, muſt be underſtood compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively (as this Author grants, though he deſtroys his whole Argumentation by granting it:) And may poſſibly be underſtood only of bringing them to light among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are ſaid to be without hope, being aliens from the Covenants of Promiſe: For he ſaith in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49565:87"/> the <hi>verſe</hi> following, <hi>He was made a Teacher of the</hi> Gentiles, viz. <hi>in theſe things.</hi> Now, though the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Providence, taught them Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life happineſs to the Obedient, and Future miſery and death to the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient; yet they taught theſe things ſo obſcurely and faintly, That they living wickedly, and contrarily to the Light they had, and ſo making it their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to wiſh there was no Future-life, might with eaſe ſtiffle and bafle ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sentiments, ſo far as to hope there was no ſuch Future ſtate; or however, to make it a diſputable Point, as it was amongſt them: I mean, more eaſily than the <hi>Jews,</hi> that had the Law given in a dreadful manner, teſtifying theſe things, and credibly, and convincingly brought down to them by Irrefragable teſtimony; and more eaſily by far, than men now.</p>
            <p>But it is probable alſo, this Scripture is to be underſtood comparatively, to the Jewiſh diſpenſation of the Law and Goſpel, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. And indeed, though it is ſo apparent, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were taught a Future-life
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49565:88"/> of Retribution by the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, elſe thoſe Scriptures could not have taught the Foundation of Religion, and they did ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures: That it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo many Learned men ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to any Notions contrary; yet, the evidence they had of theſe things, was very obſcure, to what this open-fac'd Diſpenſation of the Goſpel affords; and eſpecially, as to the exact manner of the great Judgment by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. And of Bodys being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and made glorious like Chriſt's Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo, without doubt, the beſt of them had very little particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hope and aſſurance, ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to this cleer Goſpel-diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That they themſelves in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſhould enjoy the Future bleſſed ſtate: For they that knew but little of Chriſts ſatisfaction as comparatively to us, they did (which being now with open face known, anſwereth ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing difficulties, as they were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily perplexed with, and made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Bondage through fear of death) could not ordinarily but be much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49565:88"/> thinking, though it is apparent by the Teſtimony of God himſelf, he will pardon ſinners, yet every truly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon might be ready to ſay, he will ſurely hardly pardon ſuch great ſins as mine are: How can he with ſafety to his Juſtice?</p>
            <p>Now further, to enable any to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer many Scriptures, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor brings, to maintain his extenuating Expreſſions of the Law (Though ſuch Scriptures are not immediately ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſcover the Apoſtle's meaning, where he aſcribes Juſtification to Faith, in oppoſition to Works, elſe I would have taken more particular notice of them) Remember what I ſpoke before, that ſometimes, not only the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but this Apoſtle in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, underſtands by it; the Jewiſh Common-wealth Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Violent, Immature, Temporal death to all External viſible ſins, and in ſome caſes, allowing Sacrifices, in the ſtead of this violent death, in other caſes not. And the occaſion of the ſo uſing the word, Law, (which you may poſſibly think very Improper, when
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49565:89"/> ſpeaking of Conſcience-concernments) is this; It was the common, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Univerſally profeſſed Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſometime before, and about thoſe days of the Apoſtles, taught them by all their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> As this Author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo affirms, <hi>pag.</hi> 306. That the Law did not threaten Future puniſhment to any ſins, but to thoſe that it, as the common Law of the Land, threatned Temporal violent death to, to be Executed by the Magiſtrate: And that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more to Future ſalvation, than ſo much as was made neceſſary by it, to eſcape violent death; And alſo, that the expiation of their Sacrifices (which were for faults, granted by them to be ſins threatned by their Law with Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture death) reached ſo far as to expiate, and abſolve them from ſins as to Future puniſhment; which Opinion, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at large oppoſes. And ſince they could not but grant, that there were commands of inward Holineſs, forbiding Heart-adultery, and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther, and meer inward coveting, as the Tenth Commandment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to fear and love the Lord, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49565:89"/> walk in his Ways, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments with all their heart and ſoul, <hi>Deut. 10. 12. Chap.</hi> 11. 13. And it would not be Senſe, or it would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs ſenſe to ſay, that keeping the Commandments (as for example, of not doing Murder, or not committing Adultery) with the whole heart, was only to abſtain from the outward Fact, without avoiding the occaſions, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or cauſes thereof; They held theſe were not properly Commands, that any penalty of Excluſion from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or that Future-life death was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto; But that theſe Precepts, were only Councels recommended to them that had a mind to do the beſt, and that it was commendable, and men did well to obſerve them; but the refuſing to obey theſe, was not ſin by their Law, nor puniſhable with any Future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the wicked Doctors of this, and ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer degenerate Ages, making it their ſtudy almoſt unanimouſly to excuſe themſelves and others from inward Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which they were reſolved againſt, as being the moſt difficult part of true
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49565:90"/> Religion, and moſt ingrateful to fleſh and blood) might have this pretence from the Law it ſelf, to maintain their Fleſh-pleaſing expoſition of the Law, to quiet their own and others Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the neglect of inward Purity, <hi>viz.</hi> There is no violent penal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death threatned to ſuch ſins, to be inflicted by the Magiſtrate, as there is to all External ſins; therefore it is likely, there is no Eternal, or Future puniſhment threatned by the Law for ſuch; there are no Expiations appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch ſins, ſurely therefore they are no ſins, and need no Expiations.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Doctors did hold, their Law promiſed Future-life, and threatned Future puniſhment; but <note n="*" place="margin">I ſhewed you at the beginning, four true ſenſes of the Jewiſh Law, all intended by the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. But the <hi>Phariſaical Jews</hi> maintained a fifth ſenſe, and that a falſe and pernicious one, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Law promiſed the Future-life happineſs, to their obſerving the: Law Politically and Externally.</note> taught the people that if they were but <hi>juſti ad legem</hi> (righteous accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, in the ſenſe that <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> uſeth the word; ſaying, <hi>Exignum eſt ad legem bonum eſſe,</hi>) that is, Righteous ſo far as the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49565:90"/> Law of the Land was to compel them by Temporal puniſhment, as all thoſe were that had committed none of thoſe Crimes, that were excluded from attaining Temporal pardon by Sacrifice, and had offered Sacrifice for their other External faults; they were as perfectly righteous before God, as their Law in any ſenſe required them to be. So becauſe the Law, as the Law of the Land, appointed no puniſhment for one that put away his wife for any light cauſe, ſo he did but ſet her wholly at liberty by a Bill of Divorce to marry another, they were taught it was no ſin ſo to put away a Wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 31. Alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law, as the Common-wealth Law, gave men liberty to require an Eye for an Eye, and Tooth for Tooth, and if they ſo required it, the Magiſtrate was bound to Inflict it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 21. They were taught, it was no ſin to ſeek this revenge in any caſe. And ſo, that the Commands of forgiving Injuries, were but Counſels, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 29. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 22. Say not, <hi>I will do to him, as he hath done to me,</hi> Lev. 19. 17, 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother

Yet theſe were, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, crimes ſeldom hapning, ſo that the ordinary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the higheſt Court was (as it is commonly agreed) Stoning: And however this would no way have ſerved to have carried on the begun Metaphor, which expreſſed the Gradation of puniſhments by ſeveral Courts, ſince this was a puniſhment by the ſame Court, and rarely uſed. Now ſince the Court of Judicature is put in this ſpeech, to ſignifie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the puniſhment of the Court, it was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to rational Speech, to ſignifie by it the ordinary puniſhment of the Court: And ſo he expreſſes the third Degree of Future puniſhment due to the third and greateſt Offence mentioned by him, by a burning to death in <hi>Tophet,</hi> that was often uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to expreſs Future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> anſwerable to the being put to death with fire, in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom;</hi> which was a more cruel death than by the Sword, or Stoning; and the meaning of it well known to the <hi>Jews,</hi> though no judicial death; and uſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them, and ſometimes by the Scripture, to ſignifie Future torments. And the word ſhould have been thus Tranſlated, viz. <hi>Shall be in danger of the fire of the Valley of</hi> Hinnom <hi>or</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: For as it is Tranſlated, it is apt to miniſter a doubt to the Vulgar, as if the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49565:93"/> two former ſort of offences were not by Chriſt accounted to be threatned with Hell; whereas had it been Tranſlated according to the Words, it would have been more eaſie, and occaſioned no ſuch doubt; the Judgment, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the fire of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> all equally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Future death and puniſhment, and only here uſed to denote Degrees of puniſhment in Hell. Yea, and Chriſt here aſſigns as great a Future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the leaſt offence, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger, as they did to actual Murther.</p>
            <p>Now it will appear to you, no great unlikelyhood, that the Jewiſh Doctors gave ſuch a looſe Interpretation of the Law, if you conſider, that it is a growing Opinion at this day, taught by ſome of our own Doctors (as well as by <hi>Socinus</hi>) that no more was commanded to the <hi>Jews;</hi> however, not under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Future death, but only ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience. <q>And if perhaps, there were any Commands in the Old Teſtament-Scriptures, requiring ſuch Internal obedience, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt in his Sermon on the Mount, they were glimmerings of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49565:93"/> the Goſpel, and not Univerſally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to all under threat of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment, but only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them that will do what is beſt, <hi>Pract. Cat. pag.</hi> 141. Though now, ſince Chriſts Sermon in the Mount, they are acknowledged to be Commands, which not to do, is a ſin; and not only Counſels of Perfection, which to do, is to do better, <hi>pag.</hi> 142.</q> But Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> (if I can underſtand him) holds, that now no Law threatens Hell to the neglect of them, but that they are yet Counſels left to a man's choice. <hi>Unum Neceſ. pag.</hi> 48, 49.</p>
            <p>You may find this Opinion maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, who pretend that Chriſt's oppoſitions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. to what hath been ſaid by others, were however in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of thoſe ſayings referring to the Ten Commandments, really Additions to the Law; and not vindications of the right true ſenſe of it againſt falſe Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing expoſitions: And that the Law till Chriſt made thoſe Additions to it in his Sermon in the Mount, did not as a Law, require any, however not with any Threat of Future puniſhment to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49565:94"/> from Heart-Adultery, or Heart-Murder, provided it proceeded not to the External fact. Now I look upon my ſelf as bound, here to anſwer the Arguments for that Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That that is a true notion of the Jewiſh Law, as referring to Conſcience, and the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life-ſtate. For if this be ſo, All that I here ſpeak thus largely, and make apparent chiefly from this <hi>Chapter</hi> (which you will at laſt, I hope, ſee the neceſſity of, for the Interpreting many Scriptures of the New Teſtament that ſpeak derogatory to the Law) will fall to the ground. The ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which they prove their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſuch as theſe. <hi>Pract. Catech. pag.</hi> 136.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The moſt of the Fathers (eſpecially of the <hi>Greeks</hi>) before St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> time ſo held.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I could eaſily, I think, make it appear, that the moſt of them held the contrary. 2. The moſt of the Citations produced, may be made appear, either not to prove that to be their Opinion, but are capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſtruction, or they might be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49565:94"/> forced to that Expoſition, to maintain now-acknowledged Errours frequent in thoſe days, as that it is unlawful under the Goſpel to Swear, or War, in any caſe, though it was not unlawful by the Law of Nature, or the Moral Law.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Fathers give theſe two reaſons for this their Opinion. 1. Becauſe Chriſt under the Goſpel, gives either higher or plainer Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than he did before. 2. Becauſe he gives more grace now to perform them (<hi>viz.</hi> the Commandments) than before he had done. The Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Carnal Law, that is, weak, not accompanied with ſtrength to perform what it requires; but the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> a means to Adminiſter the Spirit to our hearts, to enable us to do what he commands us to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the firſt Reaſon ſaid to be the Fathers. 1. I cannot ſee it's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. 2. The <hi>Heathens</hi> knew by the Light of Nature, that Heart-adultery and Murther, and that taking Gods Name in vain in Swearing cuſtomarily,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49565:95"/> or Luſoriouſly, or Idle, were ſins; ſurely, then the <hi>Jews</hi> had Light enough to make them inexcuſable in theſe things, before Chriſt's Sermon in the Mount, and ſo ſuch were ſins in them.</p>
            <p>And for Anſwer to the ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I can neither underſtand the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, nor the Conſiſtency of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is apparent to me, that men are not one jot the leſs obliged by the Law, becauſe of God's not giving them Grace to obey it, becauſe I do not think that giving the Natural ability to Obey, is to be called giving Grace, or an effect of Grace, but of Juſtice, ſo as men could not in Juſtice be obliged to obey the Law without it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Law of the Ten Commandments (for that is it the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſpeaks of, and only pretends Chriſts addition to) was not in the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſenſe a Carnal Law, but a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the <hi>Jews</hi> had no ſtrength to perform what this Law required, it muſt be granted, that they were not obliged by the Law to avoid Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, and Thought-ſins.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49565:95"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Methinks this undo's all, to give this as a Reaſon, why the <hi>Jews</hi> were not forbidden ſuch Inward-ſins as are under Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Becauſe they had no ability to perform what the Law commanded:</q> For it is to grant, the Law did command them to abſtain from ſuch things, which this Argument is brought to prove, it did not forbid till Chriſt made that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The word Tranſlated, <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil</hi> (ver. 17. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil them</hi>) ſignifies to perfect, and fill-up that which was imperfect before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It cannot be denied but the word is uſed in divers ſignifications. But ſetting aſide what other things may be oppoſed to that ſenſe of the Word, I ſhall only ſay this: The ſureſt way to know the ſenſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>fulfil,</hi> in this place, is by the word here oppoſed to it, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to diſſolve, or deſtroy the Law. Now it is apparent, that by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, is meant Enervating, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49565:96"/> Evacuating the Obligation of the Law, by a too favourable Expoſition, which is called in the <hi>Verſe</hi> following, <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Commandment, and teaching men ſo to do; Therefore by the word <hi>fulfil,</hi> muſt be meant to aſſert, and maintain it's ſtrictneſs and obligation, to vindicate it from ſuch evacuating Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. The meaning of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> is, <hi>Think not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> You will be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if you ſhall ſuppoſe that I am come to Teach (as your Doctors) that are in the greateſt Repute, do, who make it their great buſineſs, to gratifie you in making the Law to be of very little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo as not to forbid Heart-ſins, but to alow thoſe, and many evil practices. I am not come thus to diſſolve the Law, but to fulfil, <hi>i. e.</hi> to vindicate it to it's true ſenſe, from ſuch Evacuating gloſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That theſe words [<hi>you have heard</hi>] ſignifies, <q>you have been taught out of the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and [It hath been ſaid by them of old time] ſhould be read (according as the Margent alſo of our Bibles tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates them) it hath been ſaid to them
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49565:96"/> of old time, that is to the <hi>Jews</hi> your Anceſtors by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, 1. The words may be read, <hi>either</hi> it hath been ſaid to them of old, or <hi>by</hi> them of old, without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or alteration of the ſenſe, for <hi>if</hi> ſaid by them of old; then be ſure, <hi>to</hi> them of old; and if it was ſaid to the Ancients, then by the Ancients. 2. The meaning ſeems to be, Theſe Expoſitions of the Law, have been taught you with a pretence of their <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calv.</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi>
               </note> Antiquity, as being taught the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, by the Ancients, <hi>i. e.</hi> that is, ſome Generations ſince by <hi>Rabbie's.</hi> 3. But that the meaning ſhould be, Theſe things were taught you by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Ten Commandments; But I now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add, or oppoſe this Interpretation, to what was the true former meaning, ſeems wonderfully unlikely by this (to ſay no more) That this is not the uſual phraſe of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, in citing Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> you have heard it <hi>hath</hi> been ſaid; neither is this <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calv.</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi>
               </note> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech, or any akin to it, ever uſed in this ſenſe; and therefore ſeems to be a way of citing Traditional Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49565:97"/> When Chriſt citeth Scripture, he uſeth to ſay, <hi>You have read, Mat.</hi> 12. 35. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 26, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 26. Not as here, <hi>You have heard:</hi> And he uſeth to ſay, <hi>It is written, Mat.</hi> 4. 4, 6, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 23. and 10. 26. <hi>John</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 38. Not as here, <hi>It hath been ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In theſe words, [<hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees; that is, which they think themſelves obliged to, and teach others that they are obliged to, <hi>you cannot enter;</hi>] Sure, Chriſt doth not pitch on the names of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as thoſe that were the greateſt Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of the Law, by their own hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Practices, or falſe Gloſſes in ſome particulars; but as the moſt exact and learned Sect, as thoſe that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, <hi>i. e.</hi> taught there truly the Doctrine of the <hi>Moſaical-Law,</hi> in that manner as others were obliged to perform it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, 1. Then Chriſt doth not bring in theſe Names here, as he is wont to do, for he uſeth to charge them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49565:97"/> with making void the Law through Traditions.</p>
            <p>2. It ſeems apparent, he means by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the ſame that he doth by thoſe that break the Commandments, and teach others ſo to do.</p>
            <p>3. I grant they had generally the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the ſtricteſt Teachers, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as to External and leſs weighty matters of the Law; but yet they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are charged to make void the Law by their Lives and Doctrines, as to Internal obedience, and moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concernments. Surely it is not all one as if he had ſaid, <hi>Except your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Joſhuah, Samuel, and David, (which they taught other, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others obliged to) <hi>you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter;</hi> which yet ſeems to be the Doctors meaning.</p>
            <p>4. The people were to hear them, and alſo to take heed how they heard, <hi>and beware of the leaven of the</hi> Phariſees. They were to embrace their Doctrine only ſo far as they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, and taught <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Doctrine truly.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49565:98"/>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Chriſt expreſſeth the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſed, or added to by him in the very words of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: Therefore to ſay, he ſpeaks by way of Oppoſition, and not of Addition, would be to ſay, he oppoſes the very Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer 1. He doth ſo only in one place of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> viz. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Any one may yet perceive, by his following Oppoſition, what it is he meant by thoſe words, and what it is he oppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Not the very Law, or the true ſenſe of the Law, but that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Law, which laid the ſtreſs on the word <hi>commit,</hi> as if it meant only commit with the outward Fact, and forbad nothing elſe: And it is apparent, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſo taught.</p>
            <p>The Doctor giveth us another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken from a ſaying of Saint <hi>John,</hi> which carrieth ſo little evidence in my opinion, that I would not have here ſet it down, but that he ſeems to lay ſo great ſtreſs, not only on this his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49565:98"/> Interpretation of Chriſts Words, as being (as he ſaith) <q>A foundation of a great and weighty Superſtructure,</q> but alſo upon that Scripture, as being (as he ſaith) a remarkable place to prove it. The words are theſe, <q>1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. <hi>God is Light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all.</hi> The meaning whereof, he ſaith, is this, That God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the rule of mens lives; and implies, that theſe had before (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's teaching) ſome indulgence for ſome ſins; and where they had not ſo, yet they had ſome mixture of Imperfection, but now they have none; they had before ſome Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in them, which are now filled up by Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer 1. I ſee no evidence or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that this is the meaning of theſe words.</p>
            <p>2. We read, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> i. e. without Imperfection; <hi>and is Light,</hi> i. e. without darkneſs, and this was ſpoken of the Law before Chriſts Teaching.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49565:99"/>
            <p>3. I cannot underſtand the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe words, That the Law and Commandments, the Rule of mens lives, had before Indulgence for ſome ſins; If no Law forbad them, they were not ſins, or if it did not forbid them under the penalty of Future-death, then they were not ſins: For, I have, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, made it appear, it threatned Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture death to all ſins, and elſe none were pardoned thoſe ſins as to Future death, becauſe they did need no ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>4. Nor can I underſtand the words following. That where the Law, the Rule of mens lives, did not allow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for ſome ſins, yet it had ſome mixture of Imperfection. I cannot imagine how this appears; for none will ſurely ſay, it appears in this, that it did not require ſome thing the Law now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, for that will no more prove the Law imperfect then, then that the Law of God is now imperfect in not requiring circumciſion; whereas the Law did then, as it doth now, require all to obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhould any way whatſoever
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49565:99"/> command them, and that under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Future-death.</p>
            <p>5. You may ſee by what hath been ſaid, That the Law, not as referring to Conſcience, and Future-life; but as the Jewiſh Common-wealth Law, did allow or indulge ſome things; that is, ſo far as not to threaten violent death to them at all, and ſo in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſenſe, did not forbid ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes at all; which yet the Law in the moſt Important and Conſcience ſenſe did forbid, and ſo were ſins threatned with Future-death. As for example: The putting away a Wife for any cauſe, and Heart-murther, and Heart-adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>Alſo, I have made apparent, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the Jewiſh Doctors taught, and it was an Opinion ordinarily received amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that if men were but <hi>juſti ad legem;</hi> that is, righteous ſo far, as to be free from ſuch things as Temporal death, was by the Law of the Land remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly threatned to, and had offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſuch as the Law allowed it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49565:100"/> for, they were either as righteous as any Law of God, in the utmoſt rigour; required them to be, or however, at the leaſt, as righteous as the Law of God in the indulgent Goſpel-ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them as neceſſary to their Future ſalvation; And that Chriſt oppoſeth in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the common Jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, taught by their Doctors.</p>
            <p>And without doubt, there was no <hi>Jew</hi> ever ſaved by that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> taken in the Goſpel-ſenſe, as all good men that lived under it were, that did not more than was required by that Law in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as the Law of the Land threatning violent death to be Executed by the Magiſtrate. As for example, that did not love and fear God, and endeavour inward Holineſs, and the repreſſing of the inward ſins, which the Law in the Political ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not. And again, All ſaved by that Law, did far leſs than was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that Law, as the Original ſtrict Law under the penalty of Future-death, For all ſaved, were pardoned as to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-death, as to ſome Heart-ſins; which could not be, if ſuch ſins were
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49565:100"/> not Threatned with Future-death.</p>
            <p>Now upon this falſe foundation (<hi>viz.</hi> That the Law of God as to Conſcience, required no more than it required as the Law of the Land) was without doubt built that Interpretation of the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. given by the Ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rabbi, <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words, which are theſe [<hi>If I regard iniquity with my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi>] gives this as the meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Though I ſhall ſee Iniquity in my heart, which I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to execute in fact; Though God do ſee it, yet he will not hear it (meaning he will not impute it to me for ſin:) For God doth not charge a wicked Thought, for a wicked Act, except only a wicked Thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Faith and true Religion, ſo as to worſhip Idols:</q> For this, ſuch Doctors did hold to be ſin threatned with Future puniſhment, though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not to the Fact, but not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked Thought or Intention.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems apparent, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> took the Law in this Vulgar ſenſe, when he ſaith <hi>Phil. 3. 6. He had been a</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49565:101"/> Phariſee, <hi>and touching the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of the Law blameleſs.</hi> That is, he had lived without fault, ſo far as the Law required in that ſenſe, wherein the moſt <hi>Jews</hi> then, and he himſelf formerly (being ſo taught by his Maſter <hi>Gamaliel</hi>) underſtood it, <hi>viz.</hi> in this external Political ſenſe. And though he had formerly accounted that perfect Obedience to the Law, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all required to his ſalvation; yet now he looketh upon ſuch Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as inſignificant as to Future ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and underſtood the Law was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual and required more, yea more neceſſarily for ſalvation, even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Piety; and ſo could not have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after that manner, of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs according to the Law, in the true important ſenſe of the Law.</p>
            <p>And hence it comes to paſs (ſince the Law was uſed by moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe days, in this external Political, and Ritual ſenſe.) That the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth almoſt (I think altogether) conſtantly uſe this word, the Law, in this ſenſe, but confutes their erronious Opinion, that held that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49565:101"/> in this ſenſe it availed to Salvation in a Future-life; and ſhews it in this ſenſe, made none perfect as to Conſcience, or Future-life concern's, but only as it threatned violent death, and excluſion from Society; ſo the Sacrifices for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, reached not to Expiate ſins as to Future-life concerns, but only to free from the Temporal puniſhment of Death, and Excluſion from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>And hence alſo it comes to paſs, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> often uſeth the word, <hi>the Law,</hi> in this Political ſenſe, Though it is apparent he doth not ſo, when he denies Juſtification by the Law as to Future-life, by reaſon of mens ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as it is apparent he doth in thoſe places, that ſeem oppoſite to St. <hi>James.</hi> (And this Author alſo confeſs it) For mans ſinfulneſs, could not poſſibly be any reaſon why men were not Juſtified as to Future-life by the Law, in that Political ſenſe, wherein it neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Future-life, nor threatned Future death.</p>
            <p>You muſt obſerve diligently, as you deſire to underſtand the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49565:102"/> many places, that he often paſſes from the Conſcience ſtrict ſenſe of the Law, oppoſed to the Goſpel, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth ſenſe of the Law, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and often runs them together, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. uſing the word <hi>ſometime,</hi> in one of the ſenſes, and intermixing paſſages that agree to it in the other; which I could give you, I think, a ſatisfying account of, and would indeavour by reciting the particular places; but that I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I ſpeak more largely than is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſuch a ſhort Diſcourſe as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>Now, to draw to a concluſion of this long Digreſſion, deſigned to help you to underſtand many Scriptures. Since ſo many took the Law in this low ſenſe, as requiring ſo ſhort an obedience, and fooliſhly promiſed themſelves that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, in the obſervance of it ſo far, which it never promiſed them; It is no wonder that you find ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating Expreſſions of it, in this ſenſe. Not that any ſuch Expreſſions extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it as the Common-wealth Law; for it was an excellent one impoſed by the only Wiſe God, and fitted to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49565:102"/> of the Jewiſh people, and to Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the great things; But they extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it: 1. As a way of Salvation, for it promiſed no ſuch thing, made nothing perfect as to Conſcience and Eternal life, though obſerved with the greateſt exactneſs.</p>
            <p>2. It is not extenuated as a ſhadow or reſemblance, Typical of the great things, for it was a wonderful perfect Shadow and Type; But it is extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as being but a Shadow (which the the <hi>Jews</hi> would have to be the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the way of Salvation it ſelf) of the great concernments; a poor and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Rudiment, or <note n="*" place="margin">I could, I think, give ſatisfying Reaſons, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. As that which was but Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to vaniſh away as this Typical Common-wealth Law was to do, at the fuller Exhibition of the things it was but a Type of.</p>
            <p>4. This is called the Letter; the very outward Letter of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49565:103"/> for the moſt part (though yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently otherwiſe) holding forth the Law in this Common-wealth ſenſe, with the rewards, proſperity in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the threats, Temporal death. And in its being called the Letter, it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Internal and Spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Law, as it was the ſtrict Law and the Goſpel; and to this cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Diſpenſation of both the Law and Goſpel under Chriſt, and called the <hi>Oldneſs of the Letter,</hi> being the Old common way they had been taught by their Doctors, and educated in. For the Goſpel, and more Spiritual way of the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> was New, and ſtrange to them (as you may perceive by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's Doctrine of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins, being reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) as well as this cleer Diſpenſation under Chriſt, though that was the true way of Salvation from the beginning ever ſince mans fall.</p>
            <p>5. The Law in this ſenſe, is ſaid <hi>to kill,</hi> and to be a Miniſtry of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though not only in this ſenſe, I ſuppoſe, but alſo in this ſenſe taken in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49565:103"/> Conjunction with the ſtrict Law of Works revealed in, by, and with this Law. It is ſaid <hi>to kill, and condemn:</hi> 1. Becauſe this Law did condemn with Temporal violent death, every one that did neglect any ſuch external Work whatſoever. But did not juſtifie to a proſperous life in <hi>Canaan,</hi> any but they that obſerved every <hi>puntilio</hi> of it. 2. Or rather, ſince the Apoſtle uſeth ſometimes to run the Law in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe, exacting perfect Obedience, and the Law in this Political ſenſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Law may be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and to be a Miniſtry of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe the Law did as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtrict Law of Works in reality, though not in their Opinion, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man that did not all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever required; yea, that fail'd in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any Internal command, and did alſo condemn as to Conſcience, all External failings, which they alſo held, but did not quicken, or revive, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie any as to Future-life; Not the Political Law, through it's own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and default, having no ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to any performances whatſoever:

This Law taken ſtill conjunctly, may be ſaid to condemn, and kill men in another reſpect; Taken politically, it condemned men, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them as to Eternal death by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning men, or rather, men taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by it, to go on in all Internal wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſecurely, even to condemnation by the Law in a higher ſenſe; becauſe the Law in this Political ſenſe, never forbad thoſe ſins, that is, did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them with its penalty of violent death, and they took occaſion hence, to think ſuch inward Impiety was not forbidden by the Law in any ſenſe, nor ſuch inward Piety required to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, (which may be the meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8, 11.) and ſo fell under Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condemnation, through the neglect of ſuch Piety. It proved to them a Miniſtry of condemnation in the event, through their own fault, they abuſing this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itual Political diſpenſation againſt the end and aim of it.</p>
            <p>6. The Law alſo in this ſenſe, is ſaid to be-get Bondage and Baſeneſs, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49565:105"/> Servility of Spirit, even diſingenuous and unfilial Tempers; yet through their abuſe of this Political Law, making all that it required in this ſenſe to be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. As for inſtance, How is it poſſible but the Popiſh Doctrines believed, ſhould produce and foment ſuch ſervility of Spirit, that place all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation in Externals, in the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> in Penances, and ſaying ſo many Prayers though by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and undergone by them as ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Penances; That teach, it is no matter for loving God, as ſome do expreſly; or Teach, as generally they do (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the ſame) That Attrition is enough for Pardon, and Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contrition, provided they have but the Prieſt's Abſolution joyned to their Attrition; explaining Attrition by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or affrightment for ſin, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only of danger to our ſelves by it, without any ſorrow for ſin as an offence of a good God. So here we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſay, that they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Law, as requiring only ſuch External Obedience without Love, or any Internal, and ſo did perform
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49565:106"/> the External with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 11. 42. <hi>The</hi> Phariſees <hi>tithe Mint,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and paſs ever Judgment and the love of God.</hi> Obſerve, this Love is called Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23 23. And by both, Faith and Love, is meant Internal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> love to God, which makes his Commands for being grievous, were void of filial ingenuous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Though I grant ſome Scriptures of the like import, may poſſibly be apli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the whole <hi>Moſaic-Diſpenſation,</hi> even as it was the Goſpel, as being a more ſervile and burthenſom way, by reaſon of the multitudes of the ritual commands which they were bound by it carefully to obſerve univerſally, which had no Intrinſical goodneſs in them to command them to right reaſon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous lovers of God and Holineſs. But meerly the Authority of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and ſo the motive to perform ſuch, could not but be comparatively to this Diſpenſation we live under, more eminently from fear in good men, as doing them becauſe they muſt do them; and not becauſe the doing them was that which a gracious heart would chuſe through Religion, and love to Holineſs,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49565:106"/> to promote and increaſe Holineſs, the Image of God in his ſoul; which may be ſaid of almoſt all the Precepts under this preſent cleer Diſpenſation of the Goſpel; and ſo ſome ſuch Speeches may be underſtood comparatively, as I ſaid before, though I incline, you ſee, to Conſtrue them poſitively and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the moſt places.</p>
            <p>But now to conclude: <hi>Firſt,</hi> There was a ſenſe wherein the old Teſtament-Diſpenſation, and Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was really, or held out really the ſtrict Law of Works as to Eternal concernments, threatning Future death to every ſin; And the Apoſtle indeed excludes any from being Juſtified, and affirms all to be condemned by it in this ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all are ſinners. But this is not ſaid to vaniſh away, for it remains in force unto this day; yea, and for the ſubſtance of it will do ſo to all Eternity. This is never affirmed to be Carnal, but is Spiritual; This indeed gives no life, though it was a Law to life; but that it gives none, is not through its own want or default, but through no mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition. This was no
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49565:107"/> Shadow, or Type, or beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There was a Senſe, yea, and this was the chief Important ſenſe, wherein the Old Teſtament Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying-Law, or the Goſpel-promiſing Pardon as to Future-life, of all Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the Law, in the ſtrict ſenſe, upon Repentance and ſincere Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to obey all Gods Commands, Internal and External. The Apoſtle never ſpeaks againſt the Law in this ſenſe (however no way except compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively to this cleerer Diſpenſation) but call's it the Promiſe, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, which He and other Apoſtle's Preached; The Promiſe, which was <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> in Chriſt. This is not ſaid to vaniſh away, but is made more clear in the Diſpenſation of of it under Chriſt. This was no Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow nor Type, but the very Goſpel or Law of Grace, and Pardon it ſelf. The perfect Law of Grace converting the Soul, and giving life to men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. This was the Law of Grace, that <hi>Moſes, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> yea,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49565:107"/> and the ſame for ſubſtance, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was juſtified and ſaved by: For it was this, That if men did ſincerely repent of their ſins, and believe Gods Teſtimonies, and Love, and Fear, and Serve God, and endeavour to do all God required of them, without alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in any known ſin, they ſhould be ſaved notwithſtanding their ſins, and the Future puniſhment due to them by the Law in the ſtrict ſenſe; And this is the ſubſtance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or Law of Grace now.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be asked, How cometh it to paſs, that the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> ſhould uſe the words [The Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> firſt Covenant-Teſtament and Law] in this Political, and not in this Conſcience-ſenſe? The account is eaſie, Becauſe his buſineſs in that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, was againſt thoſe <hi>Judaizers,</hi> that would impoſe it on Chriſtians, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo far with the <hi>Jews</hi> (however to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Perſecution, For the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe days, were the chief Promoters of all their Perſecutions) as to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſenſe wherein it was now ceaſed, and they were not to keep
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49565:108"/> it: Therefore he taketh no notice of the Law in the Conſcience-ſence, wherein it was agreed by both (or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever known to be held by him) to be incumbent on Chriſtians for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it; but he in ſpeaking againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> means, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in that ſenſe wherein it was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being but a Shadow, and ſhews that in this ſenſe it had only Temporal promiſes, and advantaged only to the purification of the Fleſh, and eſcaping Temporal calamities. Now to reply, it had alſo another ſenſe, would be true, but nothing to the purpoſe, ſince it had not in this ſenſe wherein he oppoſed it.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you now ſee, that it is far from Truth which this Author affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> charges the whole <hi>Moſaic-Diſpenſation,</hi> with the defect of having no Promiſes of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life.</p>
            <p>I have taken liberty to ſpeak largely of theſe things, becauſe I know of none, that in my weak opinion, do ſpeak ſatisfactorily or truly of them; And I have much confidence that none can give any true tollerable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49565:108"/> of ſuch Paſſages of the Apoſtle's uſed in Derogation to the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Notions and Diſtinctions of the Law, as I have here deſcribed and explained; and alſo I hope, that any one of ordinary abilities for ſuch things, may, holding to theſe Notions of the Law, give a rational and ſatisfactory account of the moſt Scriptures of ſuch derogatory import.</p>
            <p>And now to go on with the Words of the Author, who having before told us, that the Apoſtle's Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Juſtification by the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> was from the double defect of the whole <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> or Diſpenſation to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie men: Firſt, from an External de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it promiſed no Future-life. Now he comes to ſpeak of the Internal defect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Secondly, Another defect of the Law, or <hi>Moſaic-Diſpenſation,</hi> is, that it did not afford the Internal help of the Holy Spirit. And it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed impoſſible, that men ſhould be brought to Spiritual righteouſneſs, or Holineſs by that Law, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave, nor promiſed any aid of the Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:49565:109"/>
            <p>I will not ſpeak much here in anſwer to this, becauſe I have ſaid enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, either here, or in another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is not an Argument made uſe of, as is here pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they had no ability to perform Spiritual righteouſneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirits help, which was denied them, they were not bound to perform ſuch Spiritual obedience, ſince no man is bound to Natural impoſſibilities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a weak manner of ſpeaking, though common to talk of it, being a defect of a Law not giving abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform it; no Law doth ſo, not that to <hi>Adam,</hi> or of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Chriſt, for every Law ſuppoſeth Ability (I mean the Natural ability) to obey it, or it could not oblige to Obedience, and ſo could be no Law to ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This is to ſay, that men could not ſin without the Grace of the Holy Spirit to enable them. For this Author grants, as well he may, that none are bound by any Law, to do what they have no power to do. But I have at large ſhewed in another Diſcourſe,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49565:109"/> the abſurdity of this Opinion, and that the gracious opperation of the Spirit, and the effect of it is ſomething that men can ſin without; And therefore, that men have the Natural power to obey ſome other way, and not from this, though not the Moral, but have this Moral power from this Grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>It cannot be pretended here, that this Author means, the <hi>Moſaic-Law</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Spirit, to free men from the Moral impotency, of doing what they had the Natural power to do: For this would be to overthrow the thing he is pleading for, <hi>viz.</hi> The Impotency, and and Inſufficiency of the Law and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; Since Moral-impotency is nothing elſe but voluntary wickedneſs it ſelf; and would be to grant, there was no defect in the <hi>Moſaic-Law</hi> to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, or Juſtifie, but it had all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturally for theſe ends; but only the men were in fault, the men were ſo wicked they would not yield to, and obey it; and the Spirit did not actually make them willing of unwilling, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of diſobedient. But I refer ſuch
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49565:110"/> as do not underſtand what I here ſay, to my Diſcourſe of Natural and Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impotency.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the Author comes (having made, as he ſuppoſeth, apparent, what the Apoſtle's Arguments were, againſt Juſtification by the Law) to ſhew more expreſly what Works of the Law they only were, that the Apoſtle excluded from Juſtification, in theſe words, and the following.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whoſoever ſhall underſtand theſe things which we have ſpoken,</q> (<hi>viz.</hi> In the proſecution of this Argument of the Apoſtle) <q>he may eaſily ſee, that the Works which <hi>Paul</hi> ſimply exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from Juſtification, are ſuch as are performed by men without Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Grace, by force of the <hi>Moſaic-law</hi> or Law of Nature: For the things by which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth againſt the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic-Law,</hi> do more ſtrongly militate, as we have noted ſomewhere, (<hi>viz. pag.</hi> 120. before recited) againſt the Law of Nature. Now this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conſectary from what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid. The Apoſtle fighteth with this Argument, chiefly againſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49565:110"/> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that both theſe Laws are purely deſtitute of thoſe helps, by which a man may be drawn to true Holineſs worthy of God, and grateful to him. It manifeſtly hence follows, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Holineſs, and thoſe Works are excluded by the Apoſtle from Juſtification, which proceed from a mans weak ability, [<hi>ab infirmitate humana</hi>] who is in the ſtate of the Law or Nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then no man was bound to true Holineſs acceptable to God, by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and conſequently no man did ſin in not performing Obedience accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, ſince it was this defect of theſe Laws, neither of them either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Future reward, or affording abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform true Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot underſtand, how this is conſiſtent with what this Author ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 116. before recited; where he affirmeth, that, <q>Some <hi>Heathens</hi> did ſincerely and heartily love and follow Virtue and Righteouſneſs, ſo far as it was known to them.</q> Unleſs he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49565:111"/> will ſay, that no Virtue and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pleaſing to God, was known to them (which would be to make his conceſſion inſignificant) or that theſe <hi>Heathens</hi> did ſuper-erogate, or did more than they had ability to do; or than the Law of Nature required from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is to ſay, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath Copiouſly, and Elaborate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, proved only theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That there is no Juſtification by good Works performed by men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there be no promiſe of Future reward made to them, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided men to perform them without reſpect to Future recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And 2. That no man is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by doing ſuch Works, as men have in no ſenſe any ability to do. Now can any imagine, that any of the <hi>Jews</hi> Phariſaical Teachers taught them, that they might be Juſtified by ſuch Works.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall be replied, No: For their Teachers taught them, that they might be Juſtified by the Works of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or Nature, which Works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had no promiſe of a Future-life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they had really no ability to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49565:111"/> perform theſe Works: But their <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical</hi> Teachers taught them, That ſuch Works of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had a promiſe of Future-life reward, and that they had ability to do ſuch Works.</p>
            <p>I ſhall let many things paſs, that I might here rejoyn to ſhew the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of this Reply, with the whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, yea, and with the Argument, he ſtrives to faſten on the Apoſtle; And alſo to ſhew how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable it is, that men ſhould fancy themſelves to have, or believe others, telling them they have power to do things they have an Impotency to do; (taking Impotency as this Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently doth, for the proper natural Impotency, diſtinct from wickedneſs, for <hi>a cannot,</hi> diſtinct from <hi>a will not.</hi>) For it is not ordinary for Multitudes to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy this, nor to believe them that ſhould tell them ſo, nor for any but wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully weak and fanciful men: Though I know it is too common for men, to have better thoughts of themſelves than they ſhould, in reference to their Morals, and ſo to think they are not ſo wicked as they are; and that they have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49565:112"/> no Moral-Impotency (which is wicked Obſtinacy) to the doing thoſe good things, they have the Natural power to do. I ſay, letting theſe things paſs; And alſo, letting paſs what I could ſay, to prove that the Apoſtle would never have contradicted theſe Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> That men might have been Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, had they done all the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Nature, required of them; ſo as only wicked wilfulneſs (which is the Moral-Impotency) hindred them; becauſe neither thoſe, nor any other Laws whatſoever, required more than men have the Natural ability to do: And alſo paſſing by his mentioning of it as a defect in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and the Law of Nature, that they gave no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform what they required: Whereas every Law ſuppoſeth ability to obey it, or it could not be a Law, or Obligatory, and therefore no Law give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or promiſeth the proper Ability to obey it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſay, ſetting theſe things aſide, I ſhall only mind you how Inconſiſtent with themſelves (as well as with one another) both theſe Arguments are,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49565:112"/> which he pretends, are the Apoſtles two main (if not only) Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Juſtification by Works of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I have ſhewed before, (in ſpeaking to it) the Inconſiſtency of the firſt Argument with it ſelf, which he ſaith, leaneth on two Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That all men are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of great ſins, ſo that they cannot be Juſtified as to Conſcience, by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. That the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſed no Juſtification as to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, on any terms whatſoever; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one of theſe can only poſſibly be a reaſon, why they were not Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For if that Law promiſed no Juſtification on any terms whatſoever, then their being ſinners, can be no reaſon why they were not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by that Law; And again, if their ſins were the reaſon why they were not Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then the Law did promiſe Juſtification to them, on condition of their being free from ſuch ſins: So this ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which he aſcribes to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>viz.</hi> That none could be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe of two
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49565:113"/> Internal defects of the Law, which are, that it had no promiſe of Future-life Juſtification, and that they had no ability to do the things it required for their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life Juſtification) labours with the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; For if they had no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do the things it required for their Future-life Juſtification; then their diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was the only cauſe of their not being Juſtified by that Law, and not the Laws not promiſing it: And again, if the Laws not promiſing it, was the reaſon why they could not attain Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life Juſtification by that Law, then their diſability to perform what it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, could be no cauſe of their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtified by it.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould reply, their diſability was the cauſe why they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form true Piety; which true Piety was required by ſome other Law, for their Future-life Juſtification. Setting aſide the Illogicalneſs, and Incoherency of Diſcourſe, which this would faſten on the Apoſtle, in many particulars; I will only ask one ſo replying, By what Law was true Piety required of them? This Author tells us by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (though poſſibly not expreſly)
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49565:113"/> it was not required by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or Nature; neither of them, as he ſaith, promiſing Future happineſs; and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purely deſtitute of thoſe helps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might be drawn to true Piety, and conſequently by his Argument, none were bound to true Piety by them: If it ſhall be anſwered according to this Author, and ſome others, that true Piety was only required by the Goſpel: I have ſaid enough againſt this already, in ſhewing this Opinion would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroy Chriſts ſatisfaction, for any (though Partial, or Temporary) defect of true Piety. I ſhall further ask, Had the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> this Goſpel that required true Piety? Or had they it not? If they had not this Goſpel, either they then had ability to perform the true Piety required, or had not; If they had ability to perform it, then they had no need of this Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to promiſe Future-life Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to give them ability for true Piety: If they had no ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form true Piety, which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. This is to ſay, the Goſpel required of the <hi>Jews</hi> what they had in no ſenſe any ability to do; which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49565:114"/> this Author denies (as well he may, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Ability in the ſtricteſt ſenſe) any Law of God to require. Yet, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here (forgetting himſelf I ſuppoſe) hath run himſelf into ſuch ſtraits, in affirming, the <hi>Jews</hi> could not perform true Piety without the Spirit, and that this Spirit was denied them; which is to ſay, they could not at all perform true Piety; That he muſt grant this of the Goſpel, or ſome Law, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what they had in no ſenſe any ability to do, (which without doubt is falſe) or he muſt deny, that God required any true Piety of them, by any Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; which Evaſion I ſuppoſe, he will not make uſe of.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From the whole Series of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Diſputation, it is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that he only rejects ſuch works from Juſtification, which if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may ſeem to yield to men mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of glorying, and boaſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. and 4. 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 9. And who doth not ſee, that that can only be ſpoken of Works, which men do by their own ability, without the help of Grace.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49565:114"/> For it is manifeſt, that the Works which men perform through the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Grace, are owing to God, and their glory redounds to Him, as the higheſt and chiefeſt Author. Theſe good Works which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, are not ſo much our Works, as the Works of God himſelf in us. And no man can rightly boaſt of that thing which he ows to God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ere long take notice of this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 271. Since <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the <hi>4th. Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by <hi>Paul,</hi> as the Father of the Faithful, and the great Exemplar of the Juſtification of all juſtified ones; It is impoſſible but the ſpeech of the Apoſtle concerning his Juſtification, ſhould give great light to this whole Diſpute concerning Juſtification.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is well obſerved, therefore I ſhall diligently attend to this.</p>
            <p>This Author begins to give largely the meaning of the firſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of the fourth to the <hi>Romans, pag.</hi> 264. which ſpeak of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Juſtification; And proceeds well for ſubſtance to <hi>ver.</hi> 3. only he affirms that theſe words [<hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49565:115"/> to the fleſh</hi>] in the firſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> and [<hi>by the Law</hi>] in the ſecond <hi>Verſe,</hi> (which he grants do both ſignifie the ſame thing) do ſignifie Works done by a mans own power (that is, without a promiſe of Future reward, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Gods Spirit) which I ſee no evidence of, but have told you my thoughts, that theſe words ſignifie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and unſinning Obedience, or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Works.)</p>
            <p>But now <hi>ver.</hi> 3. For what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was accounted (or imputed) to him for Righteouſneſs. (Here ſaith he well.) <q>This Citation of Scripture is brought to prove the words in the <hi>verſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Abraham</hi> in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Juſtification, had nothing to boaſt of before God; And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gathereth it thus, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> not of debt, as a reward uſeth to be given to workers, but of meer Grace; And therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> had no cauſe to boaſt before God, of any thing in the matter of his Juſtification.</q> Thus far well. He goes on <hi>verbatim</hi> thus: </p>
            <q>
               <p>But
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49565:115"/> how doth the Apoſtle gather this<note place="margin">Pag. 264.</note> from the words cited. I anſwer: Some think that this Argument is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or imputed, as if the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified graciouſly accepting, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting according to Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and that it ſignifies accounting or rewarding according to Debt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never, or very Improperly. Whence <hi>Eraſmus</hi> Interpreteth the word, <hi>acceptum fert;</hi> adding, <hi>Eſt autem acceptum ferre, pro accepto ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere quod non acceperis, quae apud Jureconſultos, nifallor, vocatur ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptilatio.</hi> That is, the word impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelf, ſignifies ſuch a Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as when one grants he hath received a thing, and acquits as if he had received it, when indeed he hath not received it. Many moſt learned<note place="margin">Pag 265.</note> Interpreters, follow this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> thus forming the Apoſtles Argument.</p>
               <p>If the reward had been given to <hi>Abraham</hi> of debt, it would not have been ſaid, God Imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him: For Imputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49565:116"/> gracious and free Donation. But the Scripture ſaith, God Imputed Righteouſneſs to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Interpretation doth not pleaſe me, ſince it is manifeſt from the Scriptures, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed in the Old Teſtament, and alſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and which anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, are uſed concerning the Imputation of a thing to (or for) ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19. which every one will grant is Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Juſtice; yea, and the ſame word often ſignifies in Scripture, a true and juſt Eſtimation, and Judgment of a thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. 11, 20. And it is too manifeſt, that the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the very next verſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. uſes this very word, <hi>for rewarding according to debt.</hi> Therefore this Argument of the Apoſtle whereby he infers from the Text cited, that the Juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> was meerly Gracious, cannot lean upon the naked ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Accounted, or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49565:116"/>Imputed, or Reckoned.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Since this Objection hath a coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhew, and the right Interpretation of this Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. doth depend wholly upon it (as I have ſhewed in a ſhort Diſcourſe of the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and ſince many Learned men are perplexed ſo with this difficulty, as to be driven to Interpret this place other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than right, thinking the very word doth not ſignifie Accounting of Grace and Favour, and ſo that the Apoſtle's Argument cannot lean on this word; And ſince none that I know of, have attempted to Anſwer it, I ſhall ſpeak largely in Anſwer to this, that I may ſpeak ſatisfactorily.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words in diſpute, are <hi>Polyſema,</hi> have divers ſignifications; (juſt as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word Account alſo hath) For they ſignifie properly, and in the firſt ſenſe, meerly the immanent Acts of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to Think, Eſteem (as alſo the immanent acts of valewing, compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sums together, deviſing, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though not ſo primarily:) Now when theſe words are uſed in this
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49565:117"/> ſenſe, they may be according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and truth of things, or not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reality or truth of things. If there be an Accounting, or Eſteeming, in this ſenſe, not according to the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth of things, it is an errour of the Underſtanding, and a fault or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (though it can neither be an Act of Kindneſs, or Severity) and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcribed to God; his Judgment, and counting, and valuation in this ſenſe, being always according as things are.</p>
            <p>But the words cannot have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe here, as is apparent, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Righteouſneſs, is either an Act of Mercy, or Juſtice: For Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy, belong not to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor are Acts of that; for they proceed from the Will; and are not neither meer immanent Acts of the Will, but tranſient Acts proceeding from it, and cauſed by it. Therefore let this proper and moſt common uſe of the words paſs, as not capable of being meant in ſuch Speeches.</p>
            <p>Sometime theſe words are uſed, not for Acts of the Underſtanding, as I ſaid; But for the Rectoral tranſient
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49565:117"/> Acts of Rewarding, or Puniſhing, of dealing Kindly, or Severely; Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or Juſtly. For theſe words, when uſed of ſuch tranſient Acts, are capable of either of theſe ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and which of the ſignifications they have in particular places, is known readily by ſeeing whether it be ſome good or evil, that is reckned, or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or whether it be ſome good or evil thing that is not reckned or not Imputed. But, let theſe words, when uſed in this Rectoral Law-ſenſe, be uſed in whether of the ſenſes they will, (<hi>viz.</hi> of doing Juſtly, or Mercifully; Severely, or Graciouſly) yet this is true of them, that they always ſignifie the accounting or imputing ſomething that is not in reality the thing, that it is accounted or imputed for; but only by a kind of Law Conſtruction, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptilation; or the not accounting, or not imputing the thing that is that in reality, which it is not accounted, or not imputed for. Now if this be true, (which I ſhall after make appear, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all the places of Scripture, where the word is uſed in any ſenſe, different from a meer Act of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49565:118"/> then it follows, that when ever we read of Imputing, or accounting to a man, a thing that is a good thing (as here Righteouſneſs or Reward) then it is an act of Grace or Law acceptilation and kindneſs, and that God might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done otherwiſe; becauſe the word Implys, a man had not that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that perfect Innocency, that was accounted to him; And alſo when ever we read of God's not Imputing, or not accounting that which is evil to a man (as Sin, Iniquity) then it was an act of Kindneſs, or Grace, becauſe the very word Implys, <hi>the man had that ſin, had done that evil,</hi> that was not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</p>
            <p>Now to make it appear, that theſe words when they do not ſignifie a meer immanent Act of the underſtanding, but are uſed in the ſenſe of doing good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, kindly or ſeverely, yet they always ſignifie the accounting ſomething that is not, or not accounting ſomething that is the thing reſpectively, as I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let theſe Scriptures be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, wherein the words are uſed in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49565:118"/> the Penal, or Inimical ſenſe, and not in the Benigne, rewarding favourable ſenſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18. Where, ſpeaking of a mans Peace-offering, <hi>It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that he eat all he eats of it in two days, and burn the reſt with fire; If any of it be eaten by the man on the third day, the Offering ſhall not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither ſhall it be imputed to him that offereth it.</hi> That is, though he did offer indeed this Offering; yet, this Offering for an offence committed three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhall be null and void, for any benefit coming to the man by it, even as if he had not offered it at all; not that Godwill account that in reality, he did not offer it. So <hi>Lev. 17. 4. If any man kill a Beaſt in Sacrifice, and bring it not to the door of the Tabernacle, Blood ſhall be imputed to that man, he hath ſhed Blood, and he ſhall be cut off from among the people.</hi> That is, he ſhall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Law a Murtherer, Murther ſhall be Imputed to him, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſhall in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law, be accounted a Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo far that the ſame puniſhment ſhall be due to him, and Inflicted on him that would have been due, if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49565:119"/> Murther; not that he had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, or was eſteemed in reality to have ſhed Humane blood, <hi>Philemon, verſ.</hi> 18, 19. where there is a word near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to this, but not altogether the ſame. <hi>If he have wronged, or oweth thee any thing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Impute it, Account it to me, I will pay it.</hi> Not that he did owe it, or had wronged him; or that he would have him count that in reality he had wronged him, or ought it to him; but require it of me: I put my ſelf into that ſtate in reference to Law, as if I did owe it, or had wronged thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider theſe following Scriptures, where theſe words are uſed in the favourable Rewarding-ſenſe, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. I pray God this</hi> (viz. fault) <hi>may not be imputed, or accounted to them.</hi> That is, I pray it may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it may be accounted as if it had not been committed) not that he pray's God, to think really that they never committed the fault; which would be to admit an errour into his underſtanding; but that he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pardon it, and conſequently no more puniſh it, than if he judged it not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49565:119"/> committed, <hi>Numb. 18. 27, 30. This your Heave-offering ſhall be accounted or imputed to you, as the Corn of the Threſhing-floor.</hi> That is, whereas the people are commanded to offer their Tithes, and their firſt-Fruits to God, or they cannot without Sin and a Curſe, enjoy the reſt; Now ſaith he to the <hi>Levites,</hi> If you pay this part, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this ſhall by Gods favour be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable in Law, to your benefit and comfort, in freeing you from a Curſe, in imploying all the reſt to your own uſe, as if you had given ſuch Tithes, and Firſt-fruits of your own Husbandry, as the people do. Not that God would account it really the Corn of their own Threſhing-floor, the Firſt-fruits of their own Husbandry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. Where a different word is uſed, but next a-kin to this. <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law.</hi> That is, could one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>per poſſibile vel impoſſibile,</hi> that there ſhould be ſin committed by a man without a Law, it would not be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he would not be guilty, obliged to ſuffer, would not be treated as an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. That Righteouſneſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49565:120"/> might be imputed to them</hi> (viz. the <hi>Gentiles) alſo.</hi> That is, That though they be ſinners, and ſo have not Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Righteouſneſs in reality, yet it ſhall upon their becoming Chriſtians, be Imputed to them, <hi>Rom. 2. 26. If the uncircumciſed keep the righteouſneſs of the Law, his uncircumciſion ſhall be accounted for circumciſion.</hi> That is, though a man be not Circumciſed, and ſo be one that you much deſpiſe, yet if he live holily, he ſhall be reſpected by God to all intents and purpoſes, as if he had been Circumciſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Pſal. 32. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, implying there is iniquity, but he will pardon it, and not impute it;</hi> Interpreted by that, his ſin forgiven; therefore it Implys there is ſin, but not Imputed. Not that God accounts he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are alſo uſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures following, but are uſed in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a different ſenſe from the words fore cited; becauſe, as you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, they are not capable of being Tranſlated by the word Impute, as theſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49565:120"/> above mentioned all are, <hi>viz. Job 33. 10. Chap. 19. 11. Chap. 13. 24. He counteth me for his enemy,</hi> Gen. 31. 15. <hi>Are we not accounted of him ſtrangers,</hi> Job 19. 15. <hi>My Maidens accounted me for a ſtranger,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 12. <hi>I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them, the wonderful things of my Law, but they were accounted ſtrange things,</hi> Pſal. 44. 22. cited Rom. 8. 36. <hi>We are accounted as ſheep for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Now this may apparently be ſaid of theſe Scriptures, that either the word ſignifies a meer Thinking, a meer immanent Act of the Underſtanding without any thing of favour, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour, as one may Interpret ſome of theſe places; or if not, they apparently imply, as any may perceive upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the places, that the thing was not ſo in reality as accounted. It would be too high in me to ſay, I am certain (upon ſo little pains as I have taken to examine) theſe are all; yet, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident theſe are all the places of Scripture, where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> words, are uſed in any ſenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from a meer immanent Act of the Underſtanding, except that of <hi>Phineas</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49565:121"/> executing Judgement, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him for Righteouſneſs, and the ſame words repeated again by this Apoſtle, and by Saint <hi>James,</hi> which are plain to this ſence; and the two Scriptures which this Author cites, that I ſhall now take notice of.</p>
            <p>This Author refers us only to two Scriptures, where the words do not ſignifie meer thinking, to prove that the words are uſed for accounting, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Juſtice, and not Grace, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reality of things: But they both of them prove evidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which he produceth them to prove.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that ſaying of <hi>Shimei,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 19. <hi>Let not the King impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what thy ſervant did perverſly.</hi> Here ſaith he, Imputation of ſin is of Juſtice and not of Grace. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He forgets there is a Negation in this Speech. It is not, <hi>let my Lord impute iniquity to me;</hi> But, <hi>let not my Lord impute ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Now, not to impute Iniquity, is the very ſame thing with imputing Righteouſneſs, as the Apoſtle ſhews in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49565:121"/> this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 8. compared. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Righteouſneſs without Works, that is, without a mans being Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and not imputing Iniquity where there is Iniquity, are the ſame. <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi>'s meaning is, though I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great fault, and in truth am guilty, and unrighteous in this reſpect, yet impute Righteouſneſs to me through Grace by pardon, as to this fault; or do not impute Iniquity to me; put me into that ſtate in reference to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this fault, as if I was Righteous, or Innocent as to this fault; as if the fault had never been committed. He did not mean, do thou really account I never did that fault, or do thou in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and not in Favour, not impute ſin to me.</p>
            <p>The other Scripture which he brings, is as manifeſt againſt him as this is, which is this, <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 4. the very next <hi>verſe</hi> after this; Abraham <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and it was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs. Now to him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the reward is reckoned of debt, and and not of Grace.</hi> Here, ſaith he, the Apoſtle himſelf uſeth the word <hi>recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:49565:122"/> for reckned of Debt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the word <hi>reckned,</hi> doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie reckned of Grace, of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo apparent, that any one may ſee it by peruſing the place; That theſe words [<hi>Now to him that worketh, the reward is reckned of Debt, and not of Grace</hi>] are an Argument to prove ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid before, as appears by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Tranſlated, <hi>Now;</hi> and do lean upon this implied Foundation, to make them Argumentative, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo the word <hi>reckned</hi> cannot ſignifie, when he ſaith, God accounted it to him for Righteouſneſs, but ſignifies account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of Grace. The Apoſtle's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is this. If the reward had been given to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Works, as being a righteous man in the ſtrict ſenſe, free from all ſin, or failing in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; it would not have been ſaid, that God imputed Righteouſneſs to him, which implies his being deſtitute of it: And he proves the conſequence thus, <hi>For to him that worketh,</hi> that is, that Meriteth, or is Righteous by his own works, the reward is accounted of Debt, and not of Grace; and ſo it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49565:122"/> leans upon this, as being a thing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it ſelf, that ſo the word Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot ſignifie, but ſignifies account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of Grace and Favour, imputed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs to one not righteous, like not imputing ſin, to one which implys the man a ſinner. And the Apoſtle in the following <hi>verſe</hi> ſhews, that it is all one as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Abraham believed God, and upon his believing, God did not impute ſin to him.</hi> And ſaith, that if the Idolatrous unrighteous <hi>Gentiles</hi> believe as he did, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be imputed to them, or ſin ſhall not be imputed to them. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we had read expreſly theſe words [<hi>Shimei</hi> repented, or confeſſed his fault, and <hi>David</hi> imputed it to him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs] would it not have been all one as to ſay, <hi>David</hi> did upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or Confeſſion of <hi>Shimei,</hi> not impute ſin to him; And would it not be the ſame as to ſay, <hi>David</hi> pardoned <hi>Shimei</hi> upon his Repentance or Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and would not all theſe words [<hi>imputed Righteouſneſs, imputed not Sin, and Pardoned</hi>] equally imply <hi>Shimei</hi> was a ſinner, or one unrighteous,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49565:123"/> and conſequently an Act of grace and ſavour, in <hi>David</hi> ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The Author having, as you have ſeen, given us his reaſon why he cannot be of their mind, that ſay the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys <hi>reckoned of Grace.</hi> He in the next words tells us, how the Apoſtle gathers out of that Scripture [<hi>Abraham belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God, and it was counted or imputed to him for Righteouſneſs</hi>] that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was not imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> of Debt, as a reward is given to Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but of Grace. Thus,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I judg therefore, that the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">Pag. 265.</note> of the Apoſtle, whereby he infers out of that Citation; That the Juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> was meerly Gratuitous, doth not lean upon the naked ſignification of the word [<hi>was Imputed</hi>]; But partly upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, which is ſaid to be Imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and partly on the former ſtate and quality of the perſon, <hi>Abraham;</hi> to whom it is ſaid to be Imputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The nature of the thing,<note place="margin">Pag. 266.</note> The thing which is ſaid to be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſs,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49565:123"/> was Faith and Obedience ſpringing from it. Now the obedience of Faith, doth exclude, all Merit all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in its own Notion: For the obedience of Faith, ſuppoſeth a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Revelation of God, firſt made to the Believer, and ſo ſuch Promiſes as do by their own excellency, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite a man believing them, to perform that obedience to God, by which, as by the condition, the good things Promiſed are to be attained, and ſuch Promiſes as do not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, but far excel the whole labour (though very great) which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken through the belief of them. So it was plainly in the Example of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He indeed believed God, but firſt God had revealed himſelf to him in a gracious extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2, 3. He had obeyed the Divine command, in calling him to a long perilous Journey; but God had added Wings to his Journey, promiſing ſuch huge good things, which might even fill a decriped old man with youthful ſtrength, and might animate him to bear any trouble
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49565:124"/> cheerfully. Whatſoever therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> did worthy of praiſe, he ought to aſcribe it to the gracious Revelation, and the liberal Promiſes made to him by God of his meer Mercy, therefore there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Abraham</hi> to glory, No Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſeems to have reſpect to this, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. where, when that which was denied of one working, (<hi>viz.</hi> the reward to be given him of Grace)<note n="*" place="margin">This is his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and not the Apoſtle's</note> was to have been repeated in the following Oppoſition, and to have been affirmed of one believing thus, [<hi>but to a man believing, the reward is reckned of Grace:</hi>] But the Apoſtle doth quite otherwiſe, ſaith he, to one believing his faith is imputed for righteouſneſs, as if he ſhould ſay, upon that very account that his faith is imputed for righteouſneſs, his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is meerly gracious, ſince Faith in it ſelf ſounds forth Grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Merit.</p>
               <p>Here now I muſt (but as on the<note place="margin">Pag. 267.</note> bie) a little dwell upon the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>ver. 4. To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49565:124"/> the reward is not reckned of Grace but of Debt.</hi> Which place, that it may be the better underſtood, two things are to be enquired. 1. What the word <hi>working</hi> ſignifies? 2. What the word <hi>Debt</hi> ſignifies? For the firſt, He that worketh, denoteth him that worketh of himſelf, and by his own ſtrength, being aſſiſted with no Divine aids. For he that worketh by the Grace of God, he doth not ſo much work as the Grace of God in him, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And the Context of the place confirms this; For beſide that the Apoſtle (as we have ſeen) doth profeſſedly diſpute of the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he performed according to the fleſh, in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter;</hi> That is alſo chiefly to be obſerved, that he that worketh, is oppoſed to him that believeth; that is, that from the belief of the Divine Promiſes, and ſo whoſe works are to be aſcribed to the Divine Grace, which ſtirred him up to work with moſt great and liberal Promiſes, alſo adding a great effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Spirit, which alſo is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49565:125"/> only after and by Faith.</p>
               <p>Now in the ſecond place, to ſpeak of theſe words [<hi>of Debt</hi>] no reaſon permits that they ſhould be taken rigidly &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">There is all reaſon to take words ſtrictly and properly, when it can be done, and not to fly to this Authors expreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>it may ſeem as it were of Debt.</hi>] And had this Author given the true ſenſe of this Chapter, he might have taken the words ſtrictly; thus, If of perfect obedience to the Law, then of Debt, and not of Grace, meaning by Grace, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; and if of meritorious Works, then of Debt, and not of Grace, in any ſenſe.</note> ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Eternal life, cannot be ſaid properly to be owing to any man, though working moſt perfectly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the meer ſtrength of Nature. Neither could that be aſcribed to the firſt man if he had ſtood in Innocency, and had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver violated the Divine Covenant with any ſin; for the reward of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life being Infinite, exceeds infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the works of any Creature. Therefore it is moſt certain, that theſe words of the Apoſtle, [<hi>But to him that worketh, the reward is not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Grace, but of Debt,</hi>] are not to be underſtood abſolutely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but comparatively: So that,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49565:125"/> the Apoſtle ſignifies, that the reward is not given to him that worketh on that manner, as I have expreſſed, out of ſuch meer and pure Grace, as to one that believeth; that is, to one work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Faith. Therefore, this is the ſenſe of the words. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Eternal life ſhould be given by God to him that worketh; that is, that obeys God, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by his native ſtrength with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of God: That may really ſeem as it were to be given as of debt, and there would be to one work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt ſome ſhew of boaſting. But when the reward is imputed to him that doth not work, but believeth; that is, who works nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but from Faith, and after his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of God graciouſly revealing himſelf. Here appears Divine Grace illuſtriouſly; boaſting is excluded, all merit is caſt off: Yea, here is ſeen double Grace of God. 1. That he works in a man the obedience of Faith by his. Grace, preceding all Merits of his; and alſo, that he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for Righteouſneſs, the ſame obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49565:126"/> to a man which he wrought in him, and Crowning it with a great Reward, no otherwiſe than if the man had performed it of himſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Whereas this Author pretends, that the ſtreſs of the Apoſtles Argument in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. leans upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if men ſhould do things they have in no ſenſe any ability to do; and that in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> while they have no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do them: If men ſhould do that by their native ſtrength, which they have no ſtrength to do; this would Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or have ſome ſhew of Merit. As if <hi>Abraham</hi> had believed before God had promiſed, had believed without a Teſtimony or Revelation, or had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before he had any ability to obey; this would have Merited, or have had ſome ſhew of Merit: But God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed firſt before <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and afforded him ſtrength and all things naturally neceſſary to produce obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before he obeyed, and ſo there was no Merit in his Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I confeſs I am dubious whether I ſhould grant this to be true, or not; or if I ſhould grant it true, whether I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49565:126"/> ſhould deny any ſuch Suppoſitions may be allowed in Argumentation, ſince it would require many words exactly to determine this Logical diſpute, and would alſo require more Logical acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than he or I in theſe diſputes ſeem to make uſe of, or is fit in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to trouble the Reader with. But to be ſhort, I will grant, but it ſhall be only conditionally; That this would Merit, or have a ſhew of Merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be to do what God gave him no ability to do; yea, it would be to do what all generally grant that the Diety cannot do, <hi>viz.</hi> a formal Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. But I will grant it, as I ſaid on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> on condition that he will grant the contrary, follows from the ſame Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a man ſhould do what he hath no ability to do, it would have no Merit, or no ſhew of Merit, becauſe it would be ſo far from Merit, that it would be an abſurd, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and fooliſh act; it would be ſo far from any ſhew of Merit, that it could no way be commendable. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome may think ſtrange of ſuch a conditional conceſſion, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49565:127"/> that from a naturally impoſſible Suppoſition (as this of his is) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Conſequences may equally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as I could make appear, in almoſt any Inſtance: Take theſe, <hi>Si ſcirem me mortuum eſſe eſſem mortuus:</hi> And, <hi>Si ſcirem me mortuum eſſe non eſſem mortuus.</hi> If I truly knew I was not, I ſhould not be: And if I truly knew I was not, I ſhould be.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Si beſtia intelligeret eſſet homo: Si beſtia intelligeret non eſſet homo.</hi> Therefore, what Irreverence is it, at the leaſt, for this Author to faſten ſuch an Argument on the Apoſtle, as that either nothing can be concluded from it, or the contrary may equally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it? <hi>e. g.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> had been Juſtified by Works, that is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Author) by doing ſuch works as he had in no ſenſe any power to do, he might glory, or he had Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited; when it might as well at leaſt be concluded, he could not have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he could not have Merited. But yet to prevent the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, who uſe to ſay, we muſt not ſo much as Suppoſe things, or Argue from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49565:127"/> Suppoſitions, though only Morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; remember I put in the word [<hi>Naturally,</hi>] ſaying, [<hi>Suppoſitions Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally impoſſible.</hi>] For it is apparent, there may be rational Arguing from a <hi>Hypothetical</hi> propoſition, which is not Naturally impoſſible, but only Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As for Example, in ſuch Speeches as theſe; If a man not Elected, or to whom God did not Decree to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace, ſhould Believe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he ſhould be Saved: If a man accuſtomed to do evil, ſhould do well, he ſhould be Saved: If a man had turned from ſin to God, before God convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, it would have prevented many ſad Thoughts of Heart. Yea, this may ſo evidently be ſuppoſed, that men's Hearts may and do reproach them, that they did not turn to God before God did actually turn them; or did give them ſuch Grace as would actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them; becauſe, before God did thus turn them, or give them the Grace of Converſion, they had the Natural ability to Convert and turn to God, and only their Moral-Impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is voluntary Wickedneſs,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49565:128"/> hindred them; elſe it would not have been their duty ſo to turn, or their ſin not to turn. So, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If an Angel of He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven ſhould Preach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, he ſhould be accurſed.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John 8. 55. If I ſhould ſay, I know him not, I ſhould be a lyar like to you:</hi> And theſe are rationally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable Suppoſitions; becauſe an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in Heaven hath, and Chriſt on Earth had, the Natural power to Speak or Teach falſhood; though yet joyned with ſuch a Morally inſuperable holy rectitude of Will, that they could not obtain of themſelves ſo to Speak or Teach. And this is not like doing what they have not the Natural ability to do; And the contrary doth not here follow from theſe Suppoſitions: For you cannot ſay, If a confirmed Angel from Heaven ſhould Teach errour, he ſhould not be accurſed; or if Chriſt ſhould have denied he knew God, he would not have been a Lya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; which yet might have been ſaid, if this had been, To do, what they had not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power to do; becauſe then, ſo to Teach or Speak, would neither have
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49565:128"/> been Laudable nor Culpable, and ſo not formally a Lye, nor a cauſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accurſed. Neither can you ſay, if a non-Elect man had believed, he had not been ſaved. My diſcourſe of <hi>Natural and Moral-Impotency,</hi> will make what I here ſay, more plain to you.</p>
            <p>This Author ſpeaks often, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly here of the neceſſity of Grace, and of mans Diſability to do any good, without the Grace of the Holy Spirit; which may much puzle men not verſed in ſuch Diſcourſes: And the knowing what he means by the word GRACE, would do much to ſhew further the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the Argument, from a defect of Internal Grace, which he pretends the Apoſtle makes uſe of. Now, though the Author ſpeak not much Explicitly, to tell us what he means by this Grace, and what the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it is; yet thus much is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the conſtant Tenor of his Diſcourſe, that he goes the common Remonſtrant way, and holds that the Effect of it is, The giving that Internal power or ability, that men could not
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49565:129"/> be inexcuſable in not obeying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel without: and whoſoever doth ſo, may be forced (by a little Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I have elſe-where made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) though againſt his will, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that he means no more by it, than God's giving men that enjoy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the very power or faculty of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in <hi>actu ſecundo;</hi> without which, they could not ſin, or be ſound men, or men in their right wits. Yea, all that ever I have read of that way, do apparently mean no more by Grace, (not ſo much as thoſe by ſome-admired Letters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> in anſwer to the Lord Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> excepted;) though ſome pretend a great ſatisfactorineſs in the Scheme there propounded, as if it avoided the common inconveniences that Way is Clogged with. For there the Learned Doctor, though he ſeems cautelous to hide his meaning, in calling it a Supernatural power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Goſpel; yet it will appear plain enough, that he means by it no more than the very Power and Faculty of Free-will, to any Intelligent man that ſhall conſider theſe his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following concerning it.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49565:129"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He holds, that if this Grace of the Holy Spirit, or this Grace of Converſion was denied men that enjoy the Goſpel, they would be excuſable, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. that is, They could not be guilty of ſinning againſt, or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel (for nothing that is truly ſin is excuſable.) Yea, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſtill conſonantly to this, that if it ſhould be denied any man in this life, enjoying the Goſpel, as he thinks it was to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſuch a one would be as one naturally dead; even from under the command of Obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: For his non-obedience in this caſe, would be imputable to God, <hi>pag.</hi> 94. 95.</p>
            <p>I grant, that if God had totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of the Natural power of obeying his Calls, <hi>viz.</hi> By depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him of the right Natural uſe of his Faculties, by making him a Natural Fool; then his Non-converſion, and Non-obedience to the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand after ſuch deprival, would, as the Doctor ſaith, have been imputable to God; and therefore his Non-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in ſuch a caſe, would have been no ſin, but wholly excuſable; becauſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49565:130"/> imputable to God. But that a man having the faculties to underſtand, and do Gods Commands, ſhould not be to blame in not doing ſuch Commands, except God give him the Internal grace of his Spirit, is ſtrange Diſcourſe, though too common.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He affirms, that Grace doth not give To will to any, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unwillingneſs or reſiſtency of will from any, any fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther than by meerly giving Power or Ability to comply with the Goſpel, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his diſlike of it, as a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit for any to hold, that, Grace cauſeth actual willingneſs, or taketh away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to good, any further than by meerly giving power to the Will to obey and comply with the Goſpel, which Grace gives to all enjoying the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it ſhould be granted, that God doth any more towards any man's Converſion that enjoys the Goſpel, than give this Power without which men would not be Inexcuſable in not obeying it, which he calls ſufficient Grace, (as he ſuppoſes God may do
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49565:130"/> ſome ſingular External thing providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially for ſome, as by afflicting them, though no ſingular Internal thing by his Spirit) he then ſuppoſes, that what is done more for any man, than this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace ſufficient to render men inexcuſable, is not an effect of Grace properly ſo called, or to be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Supernatural grace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I ſhould ſay, that giving that ability without which men could in no ſenſe obey the Goſpel, is to be called an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Juſtice, and not of Grace; ſo that God cannot in Juſtice condemn men for not obeying the Goſpel, if he did not give them ſo much power as to make them inexcuſable in not obeying it; which if true, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to be called Internal-grace, in the converſion of one enjoying the External or Objective evidence, the Goſpel, according to his Principles.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Doctor affirms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to the ſame Principle, That Mans reſiſting, and refuſing to comply with the Goſpel, is the only reaſon of the difference of men that enjoy the Goſpel, that one is Converted, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49565:131"/> not, and not Grace any further than by graciouſly giving this power of willing to obey, or power of not reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, which is given alſo to thoſe that are not Converted: And he pretends, that he yet keeps up the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Grace in Converſion, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though one mans chuſing when others refuſe to comply with the Goſpel, cometh only from the former well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs of the man, and his preceding willingneſs to do Gods Will, which the other wanted; yet this chuſing the good, when others refuſe, cannot be aſcribed only to Free-will, becauſe this well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs of the man proceeded from former preventing Grace. Now, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any man that is not of a forlorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſee, that this doth not avoid the Conſequence he pretends it doth avoid? while he makes this preventing Grace the ſame; or however no more than the Subſequent, by holding that neither Preventing, nor Subſequent Grace, do any more towards Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than meerly give the power, and do not in the leaſt cauſe the well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of any man, any further than
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49565:131"/> meerly by giving a man a power ſo far to obey the Goſpel, as to be able to be wrought on to this well-diſpoſedneſs, which alſo was equally given to others? And to hold, that God did cauſe this Towardlineſs, and good Diſpoſition, and Malleableneſs, and Willingneſs to obey the Goſpel, (which he ſo much inſiſts on) by doing for ſuch men more than he did for others, that have no ſuch Temper wrought in them, would be but, at the moſt (if ſo much) a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Controverſy a little further, by running a little way from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Remonſtrant,</hi> and then ſtanding ſtill and yeilding to him; by yielding, that God by his Spirit doth more in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, than meerly give ability to the will to chuſe or refuſe, and doth actually cauſe the difference; And that the cauſe of to be ones thus differing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is aſcribed to ſome ſpecial Grace and Favour, conſiſting in doing ſomthing for one he did not for the other, and that unconditionately, or without reſpect to any precedent leſs illneſs, or more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his; which is the thing theſe Letters mainly oppoſe. And if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49565:132"/> that God doth thus in time, it will readily be granted by him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to do ſo from Eternity, as appears fully by his Orthodox and judicious Letters, annexed to theſe concerning Praeſcience.</p>
            <p>And whereas he grants, that if this well-diſpoſedneſs of the man (which he ſaith is the only reaſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of one enjoying the Goſpel, when others go on Unconverted) was not wrought by Grace, this would be to aſcribe a mans Converſion ſo to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as that it would be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Grace of God, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. 58. Cannot any one ſee, that this Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was unwary, and that he would preſently have faln into this guilt, had he anſwered without <hi>Tergiverſation</hi> theſe Queſtions? <hi>viz.</hi> Whether God did any more in order to the working in ſuch a man this Malleableneſs of heart, and willingneſs to obey, than by giving him that ability to be wrought on by the Goſpel into this good Temper, which ability he alſo gave equally to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that were not ſo wrought on? And whether Free-will then, here, did
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49565:132"/> not ſo cauſe the difference, as to be prejudicial to the Grace of God? And why it would be more prejudicial to the Grace of God, to aſcribe mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Free-will, and the goodneſs of a mans Temper; than to aſcribe mans being made (to uſe his own words) Malleable, and willing to obey God, to mans Free-will, and the goodneſs of a mans Temper? Or if he will aſcribe this Malleableneſs and willingneſs to obey, to another Malleableneſs and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to obey; and that to another Malleableneſs and willingneſs to obey, and ſo forward; why he may not as well candidly aſcribe the firſt named Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, to Free-will, as the laſt? For ſince to aſcribe any ſuch effect to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour and Work of God, is the great thing oppoſed, the making the difference muſt be aſcribed to Free-will at laſt, or to Chance, or to Nothing.</p>
            <p>Yet the Doctor ſaith; <q>That it is a poſing Queſtion to him to anſwer, What exception can poſſibly be ſtated againſt this his Scheme, and that he aſcribes nothing to man himſelf, but all the good a man doth to Supernatural
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49565:133"/> Grace.</q> Yea, he would ſeem, <hi>pag.</hi> 52, 53, 56. with high words (though of low Import) to out-go his Lordſhip, in extolling Grace, charging him as over cautious in ſaying, <q>[That in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, though Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will co-operate, yet the Grace of God had the main ſtroke and chiefeſt operation.]</q> And would have it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, (and ſaith, all the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants herein, concur with him) <q>That the Grace of God in Lapſed man, is the one ſole principle of Converſion, Regeneration, Repentance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Evangelical Virtue; and all that can juſtly be attributed to our will in any of theſe, is the obeying the Motions, and making uſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, which are beſtowed upon us by that Supernatural principle. For (ſaith he) God's Spirit giveth us the power, which all the good we do is imputable to; And when we read of God's working in us to will, and to do; the meaning is, he giveth us power to will, and do.</q> But if this be the Opinion of the Doctor, and all the Remonſtrants, as he ſaith here, at
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49565:133"/> leaſt Implicitly; it is, <hi>viz.</hi> That obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motions, and making uſe of the Powers, which God beſtoweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, may juſtly be attributed to the Will, ſo, as not to any ſpecial operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, he only giving us the Power, and wholly leaving it to men to make uſe of it, without doing any more by his Spirit, to cauſe us to make uſe of it; I ſhall ſay, <hi>Sit anima mea cum contra-Remonſtrantibus,</hi> in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Though ſtill I grant, that in a ſenſe, though in a very remote ſenſe; he that giveth the Tallent or Power, may be ſaid to be the cauſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, though yet in no other ſenſe, than by giving the Tallent or Power. But why then do any pray God, to cauſe them by his Spirit, to improve their Tallent, and make uſe of their power, if he do no more than meerly give the Tallent or Power, which he doth to all?</p>
            <p>But if this be the Import of all theſe great words, as apparently it is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Grace, and Supernatural-grace, given to all that enjoy the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> That Supernatural-grace giveth them
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49565:134"/> the very Power of Free-will, or that Power (call it what you will) without which, men could not be Inexcuſable in not obeying the Goſpel; and God goeth no further by his Spirit with any in order to their Converſion; and this Power doth all in Converſion, and in cauſing the difference; therefore Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural-grace doth all good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Imputable to the man in the whole work: I ſay, if this be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is an empty ſound, and exalts Gods ſpecial Grace and Kindneſs no more in, and oblidges a man no more to, ſpecial Thankfulneſs for, the work of this Converſion; than if it was ſaid, God by his Supernatural-grace made us Men, endued us with Underſtanding and Will; And man doth all in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Goſpel to his own Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, therefore God doth all: Or, God by his common Providence, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth men to have Free-will, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will doth all, therefore God doth all. Neither doth it denote any more any more or leſs of Kindneſs in God, or engage men any more or leſs to Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to ſay, God by his ordinary
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49565:134"/> Providence gave Free-will, or the Power (be it what it will) without which he could not be Inexcuſable, in not obeying the Goſpel; than to ſay, God by his Supernatural-grace, gave Free-will, or the Power aforeſaid; while it is only Free-will, or the Power without which men could not ſin in not obeying the Goſpel, that is ſaid to be given either way. Neither would it any more or leſs hinder a man's boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That although he received the Power from God as others did, yet, that he differs from them, or made good uſe of the Power, he owes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Free-will. Neither would this be a Diſpute of any Importance in Divinity to be determined, whether Supernatural-grace cauſed this Power, or common Providence (though it would be a groſs Impropriety to ſay, Men could not ſin without Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-grace.) Yea, it is all one, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Concerns, whether you call this Power, the Remote and Fundamental Power (to uſe the words of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and others) or the <hi>Proximate</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Free-will, while there is meant
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49565:135"/> by it only that Power, without which, men that enjoy the Goſpel could not ſin; or which is all one, be Inexcuſable in not obeying it, and which is given to all that enjoy the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now it is ſo apparent, that it is a wonder that any ſhould have the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of men, and not acknowledg it; That Grace actively taken for God's Act, or paſſively for the effect of this Act, in mens Converſion, ſieth not in God's cauſing, or mans receiving the very Power or Faculty of Free-will; or the Power without which men could not culpably ſin, or be inexcuſable in not obeying the Goſpel; but it lieth in Gods doing or giving, and mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome thing from him, that man hath the ability to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil, or to Obey or Diſobey the Goſpel without; elſe a man could not pray for Grace for himſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to keep them from ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or diſobeying the Goſpel, if they had no ability to do ſo without it. It lieth in God's giving, and mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſomething, that God is not bound in Juſtice to give, or to hold
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49565:135"/> men excuſable for not obeying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; or, which is the ſame, it lieth not in giving that, which if he gave not, he could not in Juſtice condemn men for not obeying the Goſpel: Whereas God is bound in Juſtice to give the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power or Faculty of obeying the Goſpel, or he could not in Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn men for not obeying of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſuch caſes, they would be wholly excuſable from ſuch Obedience, as Infants, and Idiots are. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Power, without which men would be excuſable, being an effect of Juſtice, is not to be accounted as the Doctor calls it, an effect of Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-grace, nor of Grace or Favour, or Kindneſs at all: Do not miſtake me, I mean only; It is not of favour or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give this Power, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn men for not doing what they had not this Power, which makes inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, to do: For I know, it is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Kindneſs, and a great one too, to give men ability to chuſe the Good, and refuſe the Evil; becauſe, without it, they would not have the very Natural power of obtaining the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49565:136"/> Promiſed great good Things; and he might juſtly deprive all men of this Power, as he doth ſome, even natural Fools; provided that when he doth ſo, he doth not require them to chuſe the Good, and refuſe the Evil: But yet upon Suppoſition, that he will require them to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil, it is neceſſary in juſtice, that he give them ſo much ability, to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil, as may make them Inexcuſable in not doing it; and only ſo much as he doth for them more than this, in order to the overcoming their wickedneſs, and Averſation to Good, and cauſing them to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil, is of Grace, and Favour, and Kindneſs; being more than is due in Juſtice to be done, to free them from Condemnation for the not doing it: All which, is <hi>Diametrically</hi> oppoſite to the Doctor's Notion of Grace, who maintains the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, I may be thought to have let my Pen ramble here too far, in oppoſing theſe Letters of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; but I was Induced to it by ſuch Reaſons as theſe.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:49565:136"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe, though it will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to any Intelligent conſidering man that reads this Author's Book, that he hath the ſame common Notions with Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> about Grace; yet they lie more remote from vulgar Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; he ſpeaking ſo little <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> to declare what he means by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe I look upon this Opinion, maintained in the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as deſtructive to all true Piety, if Practically held; for no man that holds ſuch Principles, can ſeriouſly with his Heart, pray or praiſe God for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or Sanctification of himſelf or others (as I have ſhewed Irrefragably elſe-where) not ſo much as in the words of the Common-Prayer. If any doubt of this, let them but take the Book and read ſuch Prayers, and ſee if they can think the meaning of ſuch Prayers, is, that God would give them and others, only that Power to obey, which he is bound in Juſtice to give them, whether they pray or pray not for it, or could not condemn them for not obeying, as is apparent of that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49565:137"/> Power without which men would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe thoſe Letters are commonly pretended to be Unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and they that are not competent Judges, may have this probable account to think ſo, becauſe there is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (that I know of) of any Reply made by his Lordſhip, nor Intimation of his being unſatisfied with them, when as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his Lordſhips concurrence with him. For my part, though I ſhould judg that his Lordſhip (having as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth, not much ſtudied ſuch things) had not very cleer Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Controverſies, if his words be ſet down to the beſt Advantage by Doctor <hi>Hammond;</hi> as appears by his granting, that the effect of the Grace of the Holy Spirit is ſomething, that if denied to men they would be excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet, I think it almoſt as eaſie a matter to Vindicate what he ſaith in the Main, in the important Points of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, and unconditionate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, againſt Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as to Write ſo much Paper.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49565:137"/> And I cannot but highly commend to conſideration, that ſober Sentiment of his Lordſhip, who confeſſing his own Diſability, to reconcile the conſiſtency of Grace, and Free-will in Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being ſenſible they muſt both be maintained, tells us: <q>He ever held, and ſtill doth hold it the more pious and ſafe way, to place the Grace of God in the Throne where we think it ſhould ſtand, and ſo to leave the Will of Man to ſhift, for the maintenance of its own Freedom, as well as it can; than to eſtabliſh the Power and Liberty of Free-will at the heighth, and then to be at a Loſs how to maintain the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Gods Grace.</q> Though Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Hammond</hi> expreſſeth his diſlike of this Saying, and that he thinks it no great difficulty to Reconcile them; but that this way of his doth it ſatisfactori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is eaſie of Conception, (and it is indeed too eaſie of all conſcience to be the truth.) The Reſult whereof is, that God by his Spirit and Grace, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth only the Power, without which men enjoying the Goſpel would not be
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49565:138"/> Inexcuſable, which is indeed no other than the proper Natural power of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, whatever can be pretended to the contrary: And though he hath ſome Expreſſions that one unwary, or not verſed in ſuch things, would think ſounded ſomething more, as Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing operative and moving; yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, he means, it no otherways moves, than by giving this Power of not reſiſting the Goſpel, without which men enjoying the Goſpel, would be excuſable in not oheying it, which is given to all; and to ſay otherwiſe, would be to overthrow his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, as will fully appear to any one that will but read conſiderately, and ſuppoſe thoſe Queſtions put concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch Dubious words, which I have put, <hi>pag.</hi> 65, 66, 67, 68. of my Diſcourſe of <hi>Natural and Moral Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> to force the Explaining of ſuch words; and alſo conſider what would be anſwered to them.</p>
            <p>I judg that one great cauſe of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Hammond</hi>'s miſtakes under debate, as well as of this Author's, was chiefly their want of diſtinct Notions about
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49565:138"/> Natural and Moral Impotency, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their affirming, as both of them do, and the Doctor particularly, <hi>pag.</hi> 86. that, It is a direct contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hold a Power in one ſenſe, and a want of Power in another ſenſe, to the ſame Act; to hold, That a man hath a Moral impotency, to do what he hath a Natural power to do: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, alſo his not diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Natural and Moral Irreſiſtibility. It is alſo apparent, that another great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>auſe of his miſtakes, is, his forgetting, or not conſidering that men are Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally wicked; elſe he would not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſe it Irrational to hold, (as he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 36. and 38.) that no one man that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d power enough to obey the Goſpel, ſufficient to render him Inexcuſable in not obeying it, (as I think all have that have the Goſpel, and are not Natural Fools) did ever obey the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of ſome further Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effluence of Grace, to make him Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Unwilling. Now if this be not to forget, or deny that all men are wicked, ſo wicked that their Enmity and Averſation of will to Good, will
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49565:139"/> never be overcome but by the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt; I know not what is. And I grant, that except men were U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally wicked, it would be Irrational to ſuppoſe that of ſuch Multitudes, none ſhould obey without ſuch Grace.</p>
            <p>But I think, I have ſaid enough in my Diſcourſe of <hi>Natural and Moral Impotency,</hi> to ſhew the Danger, and Inconſiſtency of ſuch Opinions, as theſe Letters of the Doctor's are written to maintain; (though I living obſcurely, had not ſeen thoſe Letters when I wrote that Diſcourſe.) And if yet any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent man ſhall ſatisfie me, that I have not ſaid enough there to this end, or that there is any thing ſaid in thoſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that needeth a more particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I may probably ſay more: For my great Averſation to ſuch Principles, will much encline me upon an eaſie call to oppoſe the Prevalency of them, till I ſhall ſee ſome ſitter man of our own Church and Language, where they prevail (as I doubt not but there are many, whoſe Abilities and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances make them far more fit) willing to undertake it, and ſave the Labour of my weak Endeavours.</p>

I anſwer, Idolatry, the greateſt of Impieties, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf plainly teſtifies, <hi>Joſhu. 24. 2, 3. &amp;c.</hi> where God ſaith in the plural Number, <hi>That the Fathers of the</hi> Hebrews <hi>ſerved other Gods:</hi> And he expreſſes whom he means, [<hi>Thareh,</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Father of <hi>Nachor,</hi>] ſo that he puts thoſe three, the Father with the Children, in the ſame Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alſo, after he had ſaid [<hi>they ſerved other gods,</hi>] he adds; [<hi>And he took your Father</hi> Abraham,] <hi>ver.</hi> 3. evidently denoting, that this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated amongſt the kindneſſes to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> that when their Anceſtors, <hi>viz.</hi> the Grand-Father of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both by his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nahor,</hi> living with their Father in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped other gods; God of his meer Mercy, without any merit of his, took <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave to him a Heir, and an Inheritance: Alſo the Apoſtle ſeems in theſe words [<hi>of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the ungodly,</hi>] by a tacit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet by a ſtrong Argument,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49565:140"/> to check the Arrogancy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did abhor the Sinful and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous <hi>Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 2. 15. though Converted to the true God, by Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance, and new Obedience; And would by no means admit them to the favour of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs approved by a long and continued working, or at leaſt purg'd by Circumciſion and Sacrifices. For the Apoſtle ſhews in theſe words, that <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father (and ſo they in him) was called in the ſame manner from Idolatry, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of falſe Gods: And was, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his belief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Obedience given to the Divine vocation (yea before he was Circumciſed, as is a little-after ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) accepted of God. Who would not here admire the divine wit of the Apoſtle! Furthermore, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all Juſtified, ſince there is none that is not guilty of hainous ſins before Grace received, &amp; ſo who doth not need Pardon, and Divine Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Which the Apoſtle well proves by a Teſtimony out of <hi>David, ver.</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:49565:141"/> 6, 7, 8. And afterward the Apoſtle paſſes to the Controverſie concerning Circumciſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author here indeed giveth the true ſenſe of many <hi>verſes</hi> in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Rom.</hi> 4. But the fault is, he fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apoſtle to bring them in Deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, or as Ropes of Sand without any coherence; as when he ſaith, [The Apoſtle alſo conſidereth the former ſtate of <hi>Abraham,</hi>] whereas the Apoſtle in this Chapter, brings it in Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively; and, had the Author given a right Interpretation of the Verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he might readily have ſeen how this of <hi>Abrahams</hi> being ungodly, comes in moſt rationally to prove, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not Juſtified by Works, but by Righteouſneſs Imputed to him, and that his Juſtification was of Grace, and not of Debt. So, whereas he tells us, that [the Apoſtle doth afterward, <hi>viz. verſe</hi> 9. paſs to the controverſie of Circumciſion] there is no paſſing to a new Controverſie; but the Apoſtle there draweth an Argument from that, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified upon his Believing and Obeying God before he
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49565:141"/> was Circumciſed; to prove that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not Juſtified by Works, in the ſenſe wherein he oppoſes his Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works, as I have elſe-where made apparent.</p>
            <p>Now he comes to give us the Reſult of his thoughts, how his ſenſe of this Chapter, tends to Reconcile the two Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Hence there cleerly ſhines forth an Agreement between <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> when from the ſame Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> one concludes that a man is Juſtified without Works, the other by Works, <hi>viz. Paul</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh; ſuch as he was before his calling; but <hi>James</hi> conſiders him as now being already favoured with Grace and Divine Vocation. One denies his Juſtification by works done before Faith; the other aſcribes his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his works proceeding from Faith. And ſo, there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction here between the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is (if I may borrow a phraſe from <note n="*" place="margin">Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigene, <hi>lib. 6.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Celſus</hi>) like caſting Lots what to ſay,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49565:142"/> to Reconcile the Apoſtles. And this is the common Evaſion of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when an Argument is brought againſt them from ſuch paſſages in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to prove that no man is Juſtified by the Merit of Works, or perfect Obedience.</p>
            <p>Further, It is notoriouſly falſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> here conſiders <hi>Abraham</hi> as he was before the Divine calling, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſpeaks expreſly of him as believing, and having ſuch a ſtrong Faith as overcame great Oppoſitions; and of his being Juſtified by ſuch Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He proves, that when he Believed and Obeyed, he was not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Works, in the ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he excludes his Juſtification by Works, <hi>viz.</hi> by perfect Obedience, or Jewiſh Obſervations, or Meritorious Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He as equally excludes Works done after Faith, as before, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch works as he excludes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtle brings this Circumſtance, to prove he was not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49565:142"/> by Works, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was Juſtified before Circumciſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. which he could not have done, had he in ſpeaking of him conſidered him as he was before the Divine Call, ſo as to deny his Juſtification by works done before it. For had this been his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deny his Juſtification, only by ſuch works done in his eſtate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm; it would rather have further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this denial, and have added force to it by way of Argument, could he have ſhewed that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not till after his Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Receiving the Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Phariſaical-Jews</hi> which the Apoſtle there oppoſeth, would not, be ſure, pretend that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified while he lived in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh courſes, before the Divine Call, that the Apoſtle ſhould need to oppoſe it. Yea, it was their Intereſt, if they would maintain their firſt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of Excluding the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Gentiles</hi> from Salvation and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to Plead (though falſe) that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not Juſtified, till Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49565:143"/> or, (which is true) that he was not Juſtified while he lived in Heatheniſh courſes, as they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (though falſly) the Uncircumciſed Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> did. But for the true meaning of this whole Chapter, ſince I would not needleſly repeat the ſame thing: See my ſhort Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſet before you all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that our Author ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the only two Arguments, that he tells us, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> maketh uſe of, againſt Juſtification by the Law, and Works, that concern the whole Body of the <hi>Moſaic-Law,</hi> containing in it (as he ſaith) the Moral-Law. He next proceeds, <hi>viz. Chap.</hi> 14. to tell us how the Apoſtle oppoſeth the Ritual, and Ceremonial-Law, but he ſpends but few Lines about it; ſaying, there is no diſpute about that among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chapter</hi> 15. is ſpent in Citing out of ſome Authors, ſome ſayings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Defence of the Power of Free-will, without the Grace of the Spirit, which he ſpeaks againſt, though
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49565:143"/> many of them may be capable of no ill Conſtruction; poſſibly meaning no more, than that men have the natural Power of Free-will (without which they cannot be men, or guilty of ſin) from common Providence: And not that the Will is not Morally inſuperably wicked without Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chapter</hi> 16. He well ſhews out of Jewiſh Authors, that it was a common errour amongſt them, to think they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed the Law, and did all it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; if they didbut ſome few Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, thinking thoſe Precepts that required Inward-Holineſs, and Heart-Obedience, were only Counſel, and not Commands; and ſo, in ſtead of bringing up their Lives to the Law, they maintained ſuch Opinions as brought the Law down to their Lives; as, that it required no more than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal partial Obedience.</p>
            <p>But I cannot but wonder at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary which he draws hence, and makes uſe of as an Argument againſt others; which is this: <hi>Pag.</hi> 318. <q>Hence it is manifeſt, that they do
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49565:144"/> widely Err from the Scope of the Apoſtle, that hold that he diſputes againſt perfect Obedience to the Law, as a defended and received Opinion amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> for it is manifeſt out of what I have ſaid, that they were ſo far from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that they were content to ſtand ſtill within the bounds of too Imperfect Obedience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is this Author ſerious? Let me ask a few Queſtions ſeriouſly. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it more likely, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould maintain Perfection in this Life, and that a man may be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Law, without the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Pardon; that holds there is not any Law of God, that requires more than Chriſtians that are ſincere, ordinarily perform? Or he that holds, that God is ſo Holy, and his Law ſo Exact, that though he believes God will accept his weak Endeavours, yet thinks, he falls ſhort every day in many things, ſo as to need Pardon, and the Blood of Chriſt for ſuch fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:49565:144"/>
            <p>Whether is a Proteſtant that holds he falls ſhort of his Duty in every thing; or a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> that holds that God's Law requires ſo little, that he can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-erogate, and do more than God requires, likelier to hold Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>Whether is a man that holds, that God's Law requires him to Love and Serve God with all his Heart, and Soul, and Strength, likelier to hold Perfection in this Life, or a man that holds, that Luke-warmneſs is no ſin? As a great Doctor<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctor</hi> Taylors Ret. of <hi>Prayer,</hi> Serm. 5. pag. 46.</note> doth in theſe words: <q>There is but one thing in the world that God hates beſide Sin, and that is Indifferency, and Luke-warmneſs, which although it hath not in it the direct Nature of Sin, yet it hath this Teſtimony from God, that it is Loathſome and Abominable; And excepting this thing alone, God never ſaid ſo of any thing in the New-Teſtament, but what was a direct Breach of a Commandment.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="276" facs="tcp:49565:145"/>
            <p>This Author takes much pains (<hi>pag. 327. &amp;c.</hi>) to prove, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Eleventh Article of Religion, by theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> [We are accounted Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith, and not for our own works or deſervings. Wherefore, That we are Juſtified by Faith only, is a moſt wholſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort.] I ſay, by theſe words, doth not attribute any Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Dignity to Faith, more than to other Virtues, in the buſineſs of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now, I diſlike not this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at all, and ſo ſhall ſay nothing here.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The Reader may hence ſee how Improbable that is, which he tells us in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Reverend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> ſaying. <q>He did nothing in putt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
